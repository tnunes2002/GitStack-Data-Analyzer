COMMIT,  DISCARDED, Add TextCat recipes (#54) * Initial commit for openai textcat * Adapt NER code to textcat use case * Remove textcat.openai.correct We don't really need to do correction if we're filtering things out. * Run black and isort on openai_textcat * Add bias parameter for chatgpt positive cases * Remove refactor attempt * Add model in the loop for active learning * Add sample prompt for textcat * Fix parameters * Update parser for the GPT results * Add lite version of data for debugging * Update recipe and fix some missing keys * Add fetch recipe for textcat * Increase timeout for bulk fetch requests * Increase number of retries for 429 requests * Increase retries and timeout * Add openai.textcat.suggest recipe This recipe accepts a negative_bias parameter from 0 -> 1 that decides if a particular negative example from ChatGPT will be shown in the stream. When filtering, a random number is generated [0, 1]. If that random number is less than the bias parameter, then that example will be shown. Else, it is ignored. Positive examples are always shown in order to correct false positives. * Remove TODOs * Switch logic for accept and reject * Add timeout * Add dump of results from textcat.openai.fetch * Remove lite sample because of redundancy * Improve timing for client * Generalize textcat to any other label * Parametrize labels properly * Fix duplicate calls to load_dotenv * Refactor a few functions to accommodate multilabel prompts * Fix a few dataclasses errors * Add prompt for exclusive textcat * Fix some docstrings * Refactor textcat for binary classification I decided to make textcat exclusive for binary classification and just create a new file for multilabel classification. I also removed textcat.openai.teach because I think textcat.openai.suggest does the same job. * Fix verbose flag * Add explicit instructions in multilabel template * Add separate file for textcat_multilabel * Fix view_id when doing non-exclusive choices * Include meta key if not present in example * Remove dump file from textcat.openai.fetch * Include label on the UI * Fix some docstrings * Include exclusive_classes as parameter for fetch * Remove httpx client * Add base class for the OpenAISuggester * Ensure that parse_response has parity * Update base class and fix a few parameters * Refactor textcat to accept binary and multiclass configs * Improve template for multilabel textcat * Enable partial rendering of jinja2 templates * Render exclusive classes partially * Format code and improve order * Fix imports * Fix stream ordering * Add minor fixes for the Prodigy UI * Combine the prompt templates for binary and multiclass * Normalize labels when stored in db * Change function order based on how they're called * Update textcat custom HTML * Attempt to remove any instances of empty strings in accept * Include textcat.openai.fetch * Fix formatting and imports * Add a few tests for parsing textcat * Update prompt path and meta * Fix missing parameter for textcat_openai_fetch * Format code properly * Generalize the openai module after refactor * Implement TextCatPromptExample * Add example YAML files for binary and multiclass * Add better examples * Include missing params for new api * Improve prompting for examples * Handle cases when text is empty * Make parser more robust * Add exponential backoff to calls * Add .lower() check for answers * Follow how test_ner passes the api key and api org * Remove unnecessary indentation * Update the examples * Improve documentation for partial rendering * Differentiate between read and retry timeouts Read timeout -> how long to wait before passing an httpx.ReadTimeOut error. Retry timeout -> how much time to backoff. When a retry fails (c.f., retry()) * Change how we interact with OpenAISuggester Instead of inheriting OpenAISuggester and implementing your own self.parse_response function, we just ask the user to pass a Callable[str] -> Dict that takes in whatever the raw response of OpenAI ChatGPT and returns something that's parse-able for Prodigy's view_id. This should be more in line with how we usually design things. * Update tests to use the API * Run isort -m 9 to recipes * Update tests using the new openai * Add read timeout for 20s * Fix response parser parameters * Make template more explicit * Make parameter names more explicit I differentiated between openai_retry vs. openai_read. There's also openai_n that I think should be about the model rather than the number of retries. * Add docstring for _fmt_multi * Make completions API a class constant I don't think it deserves to be a parameter because users won't change it often. * Add pytest-httpx in requirements * Add retry codes as class constant * Add mock API tests * Document PromptExample usage * Pin version for pytest-httpx * Remove make_suggester refactor Add it in during the actual PR. No need to duplicate the code here. * Update contract test to test the response * Add dataset to prodigy.recipe * Make answer be str instead of bool for Prodigy consistency * Make prompt_path optional So that it's consistent with NER * Add initial updates to README * Update README with better explanations * Fix parsing for PromptExample * Include images in README * Minor documentation fixes * Update recipes/openai.py Co-authored-by: vincent d warmerdam  <vincentwarmerdam@gmail.com> * Switch prompt format to show examples first * Include chatgpt answer in meta * Update README.md Co-authored-by: Magdalena Aniol <96200718+magdaaniol@users.noreply.github.com> * Remove follow-up comment on README * Add better headers for textcat recipes * Add section on textcat training * Add render_vars option for arbitrary variables Before, I opted for partial rendering in order to include some arbitrary variables in the Jinja2 template. But I figured that this design is very shaky and makes things hard to use for another developer. Instead, I just created a variable, render_vars, for adding arbitrary variables in the template. * Include flagged examples in the stream * Update some variable names in the README * Remove equality sign in getting examples * Initial version of response parser with prompt class * Create PromptExample in the test * Fix incorrect variables * Fix textcat from_prodigy function * Update README * Update admonition * Use admonitions for everything * Add figure to everything * Apply README suggestions from code review Minor assortment of README grammar suggestions. Co-authored-by: vincent d warmerdam  <vincentwarmerdam@gmail.com> * Make param names consistent with readme * Update hierarchy for easy navigation * Rearrange examples to show a positive right away * Remove verbose flag Because it's unnecessary in the examples right away, and the explanation of the flag comes last in the README. I prefer removing the verbose flag rather than moving the explanation to not clutter the user's mind. * Minor linebreak changes for cleaner look * Rename dataset names for binary and multi data * Mention prodigy train when training models * Mention something about adding context * Improve and fix typing for mypy * Update typing and var names for mypy * Incorporate type reviews for mypy For context: https://github.com/explosion/prodigy-openai-recipes/pull/57/files * Update types based from comments --------- Co-authored-by: vincent d warmerdam  <vincentwarmerdam@gmail.com> Co-authored-by: Magdalena Aniol <96200718+magdaaniol@users.noreply.github.com>

COMMIT,  DISCARDED, change default modal to turbo due to recent update from chatgpt (#19)
COMMIT,  DISCARDED, Remove ChatGPT support, document code, small refactor This commit performs the following backwards-incompatible modifications to the codebase: - ChatGPT support is completely removed. Since this was particularly   fragile, undocumented, and an unsupported use case (both from our   part and from OpenAI's part), it is better removed until/if   ChatGPT provides an API. - The code is documented with GoDoc-compliant comments. - The NewClient function no longer receives an input struct, but only   receives the OpenAI API key. - The `Ask` method no longer accepts a `readmePath` argument, as   this only worked with ChatGPT. Documentation also makes it clear   that this method is meant to be used in CLI programs only. - The `askViaAPI` method is renamed `GenerateCode` and thus   publically exposed, allowing real library usage of the module. Due to these breaking changes, this commit should be released as part of version 2.0.0 of aiac:     git tag v2.0.0     git push origin v2.0.0     go mod tidy     go mod publish

COMMIT,  DISCARDED, Improve and simplify Khoj Chat using ChatGPT - Set context by either including last 2 chat messages from active   session or past 2 conversation summaries from conversation logs - Set personality in system message - Place personality system message before last completed back & forth   This may stop ChatGPT forgetting its personality as conversation progresses given:   - The conditioning based on system role messages is light   - If system message is too far back in conversation history, the     model may forget its personality conditioning   - If system message at end of conversation, the model can think its     the start of a new conversation   - Inserting the system message before last completed back & forth should     prevent ChatGPT from assuming its the start of a new conversation     while not losing personality conditioning from the system message - Simplfy the Khoj Chat API to for now just answer from users notes   instead of trying to infer other potential interaction types.   - This is the default expected behavior from the feature anyway   - Use the compiled text of the top 2 search results for context - Benefits of using ChatGPT   - Better model   - 1/10th the price   - No hand rolled prompt required to make GPT provide more chatty,     assistant type responses

COMMIT,  DISCARDED, Use start time as subtitle key ChatGPT has a habit of desyncing because it merges lines and renumbers subsequent lines, so using index as a key tends to cause mimatches.

COMMIT,  DISCARDED, Implement detection of ChatGPT response completion (#12) This commit addresses issue #12, which aimed to improve the automation of ChatGPT by accurately detecting when a ChatGPT response is completed. Previously, it was challenging to determine when the ChatGPT response was completed due to the streaming nature of the text to the browser. This led to inefficient techniques like `time.sleep` being used to retrieve the output. In this commit, we have implemented a reliable method to detect when a ChatGPT response is completed. We achieved this by checking for changes in the `div` class of the response element (from "result-streaming" to "markdown") and using `invisibility_of_element_located` to wait for the streaming response element to become invisible. This change allows us to obtain the output accurately and efficiently, improving the overall performance of the ChatGPT automation script.

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Can't open application on Macbook Air M2 Hello, Thanks for making this! I downloaded the arm64 image, copied ChatGPT to Applications, and tried to open it. I got the "damaged and can't be opened" prompt for unsigned apps. I attempted to follow the instructions below but didn't make any further progress. I also checked  my privacy settings, which should allow me to open it. Do you know if there's a workaround?

迷茫的形象、不知所措、未来的出路不知道在哪里；虽有吾将上下而求索的精神，但路不知在何方，空有一身蛮力，但无处使，所以走黄河，亲身体会感受黄河的沧桑变更，最终体会到人类的渺小，自己现在的挫折时微不足道，虽一时的失败，但在人生的岁月，不足畏惧，路在脚下，虽黄河 5464 公里，但一步一步走完全程；</p> <p>(2)风餐露宿，吃别人吃不了的苦，你才能火; "不想做普通人，就要做普通人做不到的事"，开车旅游，现在都会啊，风餐露宿，可不一定人人都做到，这个可以多拍拍片，帐篷、风景、黄河都拍一拍；</p> <p>(3)交通工具中，摩托车的载重力、适应力强；</p> <h2>打造一个什么样的人设？</h2> <p>被裁员，找工作难，处处被打击，人生处于低谷，需要寻找一种心灵洗涤，重整旗鼓，东山再起；</p> <h2>为什么我不做？</h2> <p>(1).如果还是一个大学生，估计可能会亲身体会一下；现在是上有老，下有小，背着房贷，天天搬砖，没时间，没能力了，只能在梦里走黄河，在网上打打赏；</p> <h2>自媒体会不会火？</h2> <p>这个真不一定，只能说，如果走一遍，也不枉此生，如果能火了，就名利双收，棒棒的；</p> <p>(1).人设要设定好，现在全国环境不好，抑郁的人、迷茫的、不如意的人很多，走黄河，要进行一次心灵共鸣，把自己假设成其中的一个，要进行一次蜕变，走出阴影； 这个不能简单的说教，要会讲故事，讲好古代的故事，再结合实际的黄河场景，借古说今；</p> <p>(2).全国处于疫情逐步放开时期，被关了 3 年，有的人想出门走走，但是因为现实原因，不能旅游，这个时候，你就可以帮他们走一走，黄河这个中国的母亲河，就比较好了，亲近自然，有山有水的，熟悉而有陌生，把最好的展示给他们；和上面的不冲突，美景和旅行总是结合在一起的； (3).V2 会不会先火起来(狗头)</p> <p><code>风餐露宿有风险，骑行需谨慎</code></p> <p><img

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Feat : two new configure items (prependPrompt,apiServer) For `prepend prompt` configure item:  - When it had configured , the ChatGPT Agent will send a prepend prompt before all conversation or include them in the first line of the prompt  - It will lead the ChatGPT to transfrom the identify from the "Assistant" to the others. It's useful for bots have custom names and backgrounds. For `apiServer` configure item:  - It let the server request the specificated server instead of request `chat.openai.com`  - It's for the user who forwarding the server using nginx(reversing proxy) rather than using forward proxy
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Signing in with google doesn't work for me: "This browser or app may not be secure" I love the idea of using chatgpt from the command line!  :)  Thanks so much for writing this tool. Here is what is happening for me so far. I try to log in with with `askai login`, and clicking on `log in with google`.  I enter my email address, and click on next and I get this message: ``` Couldn’t sign you in This browser or app may not be secure. Try using a different browser. If you’re already using a supported browser, you can try again to sign in. ``` Do you know why this might be happening?  Do you have any suggestions?

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, RFC: Message Output Format ## Summary Currently, we just return the responded reply from OpenAI, according to some comments, it would be better to make the output format customizable. ## Workaround - add an i18n entry as `format`, which value can be ```yaml   format: |     <>       <quote id={messageId} />       <message>{response}</message>       <message>Powered by ChatGPT ® OpenAI</message>     </> ``` - migrate `return` statement as `return session.text('format', { ...session, response })`

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, HI i was intreacting with ChatGpt and found an bug ,kindly check through it ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111982534/206407926-bbbdf13e-164b-4f31-a083-f234a8bdd8a9.png) As you can see abouve the text overlaps and escapes the continer as soon as a large text appears in the code container
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Suggestions - automatic continuation of long code So there is an issue with ChatGPT which is due to character cap it often stops the code in the middle, sometimes in the middle of the line. In which case we have to ask it to continue and repeat the missing lines. Would make life a lot easier if this would be possible to implement and we could copy/paste just one big code section instead of trying to merge and rewrite code parts from 2+ consecutive responses. Thanks!
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, When communication with chatGPT is not possible, Alexa should be more detailed about it (and the why) Currently, when an error occurs with the default intent (most certainly a communication problem with chatGPT), Alexa just falls back to the fail intent and gives a pretty boring and unclear message. We should catch exceptions and try making it so that Alexa can better explain what the problem is about.

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Feature request: Asking ChatGPT to explain code in Chinese or more languages Hi! I am amazed at the idea to put ChatGPT into VSCode to let it explain code more efficiently！ However, because i am not native speaker of English, reading ChatGPT's answer in native language may help people like me work more efficiently. **Moreover, through my interaction with ChatGPT, I found that its ability to deal with code wont change with language** So, I would like to add a feature to **let user set the snippets of asking ChatGPT to explain code, etc,** so that ChatGPT can respond in the users' native language

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Ask ChatGPT _practical_ programming questions **Channel** C++Weekly **Topics** The video should be much like the last video on the subj, but unlike the last video, which centered around (mostly) useless questions (who needs / cares about BASIC these days, for example), this video should ask only _practical_ (and modern, I should add) questions. Where do you find practical questions, you might ask? I have plenty of those for you to pick! In fact, you must have plenty of those yourself. I presume, you have been active on StackOverflow in the recent years, so here is what you should do in the video. Go to StackOverflow, find a question (or better — several questions), which * you answered in the past (2-3 years ago) * have _your_ answer as an accepted answer (with the green checkmark that is) * is not very lengthy (fits on a screen without scrolling). Start new ChatGPT session for each new question, post this question verbatim (you may want to include the question 'title', because that sometimes contains the actual question), then see if: 1. It comes up with an answer _exactly_ as the one you originally provided. 2. Or at the very least the answer is close enough to what you answered yourself. 3. Or whether the answer is even correct. 4. On the subject, at least? Most likely items 1-3 will be ❌. Ask follow up questions to see if it is possible ('in theory') to arrive at the correct answer. **Length** 10-20 minutes (just like the last one). 
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Unusable responses after a session has expired I just tried to use chatgpt this afternoon. Every time I'd send a prompt, I'd immediately get a message about the program receiving an unusable response from ChatGPT. Apparently at some point they'd expired my session, and even the Session command was unable to determine this, it kept saying the session appears to be usable. I had to do a chatgpt install and log in again, at which point it worked. Unfortunately I have no way of knowing just what response the program was receiving from ChatGPT, and since I've already logged in again, I can't debug this further.

It'll outlay the directory structure, explain whats in each file, and will be able to modify the right files to adjust what you want it to do.  If it can provide the above....could it also take a current code base as a starting point and provide outputs?

<p>大家好，</p> <p>之前我们<a href="https://www.v2ex.com/t/900941" rel="nofollow">介绍了我们的 A1Blocker 1.5.0 版本</a>，它的一个功能是隐藏 iOS 设备（ iPhone/iPad ）上 App 。因为这个新系统的功能，必须要 iOS 16 的设备才能支持。 不少 V 友关注了我们的产品并且提出了很多宝贵的意见，我们也在探索中，尝试解决一些困扰我们用户的问题，让它更易用。 这期间我们发布了多个版本来优化用户体验和对功能进行增强，有了我们现在的 2.2.0 版本。 具体功能可以看我们 app store 的介绍(介绍里有两个视频是用法和效果)。</p> <p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1645472970" rel="nofollow">https://apps.apple.com/app/id1645472970</a></p> <p>App Store 内搜索请使用 “a1blocker hide apps”</p> <p><img alt="hide apps" class="embedded_image" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" rel="noreferrer" src="https://github.com/flinteger/a1blocker/raw/master/static/a1blocker-hide-apps-cn.jpg"> <img alt="app lock" class="embedded_image" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" rel="noreferrer" src="https://github.com/flinteger/a1blocker/raw/master/static/a1blocker-applock-cn.jpg"></p> <p>这里主要想分享一下我们探索的过程。</p> <p>重要的变化：</p> <ul> <li> <p>最开始我们使用搜索的方式添加要隐藏的 app ，对一般用户的这个工作的很好。但是由于各种原因并不是每个 app 都能搜索到，为了能解决这个问题，我们推出了 2.0 版本仅使用系统的选择界面，但是这个界面确实使用不太方便而且有它自身的问题（界面卡死、重叠、白屏、黑屏等，想想看让你在一个上百项的 app 列表里找一个 app 也是一个挑战）而让人很沮丧。我们推出这个版本的初衷是希望能使用一个统一的界面找到 app ，可惜系统的这个界面不给力，我们收到了很多负面的反馈，这是出乎我们意料的。</p> </li> <li> <p>接下来的 2.1 版本我们重新加入了搜索的方式，并且对它做了增强。我们还采纳了我们用户的建议使用分享 App 的方式直接导入 app 信息，这非常有效的简化了搜索的流程，而且分享的 app 使用 id 唯一确定 app 的信息更准确。</p> </li> </ul> <p>可能你想问为什么要有不同的方法？因为如果你手机安装的 app 比较多的，使用系统的选择界面会可能遇到各种莫名的问题。但是由于这个选择的界面是系统提供的，我们无法定制。还有就是问题是系统的选择界面里某些系统 app 是没有被列出来的。为了解决这些问题，所以提供了更实用搜索和分享 app 的方式，操作更快而可以避免系统使用系统界面的问题。</p> <ul> <li>被隐藏的 app 恢复之后不会回到原来位置。这个也是系统限制，我们已经向苹果提了反馈，希望能修复这个问题，但是具体怎么处理是苹果的问题。 为了减小这个问题对我们用户的影响，我们在 2.2 版本推出了快速启动，把可能的被隐藏的 app 做成了一个启动项，A1Blocker 内点击就可以直接打开而不用考虑它恢复之后在什么位置了，而且如果是启动项支持的 app ，现在可以在 A1Blocker 内隐藏列表上直接打开了，之前有很多 V 友提出这个需求，我们也认为非常实用，最开始我们考虑是对所有 app 的通用实现，认为不能做到，但是后来我们认为要隐藏的 app 可能是一个比较小的集合，我们就进行了定制化，成就了这个小小的快速启动功能。</li> </ul> <p>使用快速启动的一个附件好处就是实用快速启动打开的 app 在屏幕的最左上角有一个回退的按钮，可以回退到 A1Blocker ，这样当你用完了要隐藏的 app ，使用这个回退按钮回到 A1Blocker ，然后再把它所在的分组隐藏起来，这样你就只在需要使用的时候才打开 app 。</p> <ul> <li> <p>App 锁，这是 2.2 版本的新功能之一。这是来自我们用户的需求，希望限制 app 的使用，但是并不需要隐藏 app 。当一个 app 被锁定了且 A1Blocker 设置了密码或面容 ID ，要想继续使用被锁定的 app ，需要通过 A1Blocker 进行认证后才能使用。这个能有效的保护你的 app 只有你自己才能使用。</p> </li> <li> <p>丰富的快捷指令。A1Blocker 提供快捷指令可以快速隐藏 app 和锁定 app 而不用打开 A1Blocker 。我们非常重视用户的隐私，A1Blocker 也希望尽量不要询问额外的权限，比如位置权限。我们认为可以通过快捷指令的自动化完成的我们就尽量提供基本指令，用户可以自由组合，结合快捷指令的自动化，可以进行定制化的隐藏触发条件，比如打开低电量模式、飞行模式、离开或达到某个地点（位置变化）、咳嗽（声音识别）自动调用快捷指令进行隐藏。具体可以参考我们的<a href="https://docs.a1blocker.com/#/zh-Hans/howtos" rel="nofollow">用户文档</a>。</p> </li> </ul> <p>我们还提供快捷指令的执行历史，可以一目了然的知道什么时候执行了什么快捷指令。</p> <p>最后想说的是我们仍然在探索中，我们还有很多的计划的功能，我们也非常重视用户的反馈，我们会优先实现我们用户提出的合理的需求。请不吝向我们提出的想法和反馈，说不定某天你就可以说大家都在使用的某某功能是你提出来的 :-)</p> <p>最后，为了庆祝新年和我们的新版本发布，将通过抽奖方式送出 10 个终身有效的高级版本兑换码。抽奖方式为按回帖的序号随机抽取 10 个。将于两天后（ 1 月 6

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Feature request: customized instructions Hi, congratulations for the wonderful idea you had in making this browser extension, is the best thing I installed since ChatGPT has been released. I would like to customize Web ChatGPT instruction set given to ChatGPT, for three reasons: 1) I am Italian, and I would like ChatGPT to answer in Italian, and I can achieve this only if I translate  the instructions in my language (or I can leave them in English and add "Answer in Italian" line). 2) More important, sometimes I would like to make ChatGPT just shortly sum up what the Google results say. For example, let's say that I search 10 results for "Ukraine war news", and I don't want ChatGPT to say "result 1 says this, result 2 says this other, etc." but I just want to know a summary of all of the news in a few sentences: if I just could customize your extension, I could achieve this result. 3) Also, every user could share his experiences and customizations. Thanks for reading
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Feature Request: Option to refresh website Using this with ChatGPT the session sometimes gets stale in some way, shape or form, where the "gate" needs to be closed and opened again in order to restart the session. I think it would be nice to see the added option of "Refresh tab" in the "More options" menu of a tab with a "gate" open in it.

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, ChatGPT to generate prompts I just ordered the kit to make one of these, cos it's amazingly cool.  I've been messing around with AI stuff, image generation AND text generation, and thought it'd be interesting if pycasso could potentially use an external API to generate prompts. In my research I've found that while there are external prompt generators, most of them do not provide an API.  Then I came across this: https://pub.towardsai.net/design-your-ai-art-generator-prompt-using-chatgpt-7a3dfddf6f76 So I'm wondering how easy it might be to implement something like this - I'll give it a go when my hardware arrives, but you might have better luck considering how more advanced you are with Python than I.

<p>老丈人之前和他兄弟做生意，因为疫情三年赔了 300W ，找我借钱帮忙我拒绝了他，原因是他和他兄弟做生意，亏钱了他兄弟想用资产抵亏损，我老丈人处于所谓的兄弟情谊接受了。就等于他接收了公司资产，同时承担了公司债务。当然在我老丈人眼里公司资产大约能抵债务。我反正没看出来，或者说我不想承担这种风险</p> <p><strong>1.我不认同他这种做法。我认为合伙做生意，赚钱赔钱就一块按照当时的认资分红和垫资。</strong><br> <strong>2.我老丈人说借我钱，大不了用房产抵押给我。我理解的做生意就等于在社会上变相赌博（当然不太恰当），我带本上场，本输完了就下场，而不是跟个赌徒似的我还有家产，我还能接着赖在赌桌上。</strong><br> <strong>3.我老丈人给我媳妇打电话说我和他们家不一条心，办事太理性。</strong> </p> <hr> <h2>概述二</h2> <p>之前他都是直接找我借钱，前两天我媳妇给我说，老丈人找他了，想买个车。原因是我小舅子媳妇摇到号了，没钱买车，我老丈人开始动我的心思了。</p> <hr> <p>我 TM 都快崩溃了。穷小子的时候各种嫌弃（丈母娘以及媳妇老家的七大姑八大姨，目前还不能释怀），这两年有两个就开始惦记了。各位出出主意。</p>   </details>     <p>     <a href="https://www.v2ex.com/t/909716">67 comments</a> by <a

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Readme should have a one-liner explaining what's going on here Hello, thanks a lot for taking the time to build something and open source it! I've come across this repo via the GitHub trending repos section. I think I can roughly guess what it does - but I'm really not sure. Golang isn't my language of choice, and I'm not much of a developer but I would probably like to consider using ChatGPT with Whatsapp. It would really, really help to just have one sentence at the top of the readme stating what this tool does.
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, "stop generating" integration? Sometimes I google something, but then go to chatgpt to ask it something else, which then gives  `Only one message at a time. Please allow any other responses to complete before sending another message, or wait one minute.` They recently introduced a stop generating button on the main site. Would it be hard to put that in the extension? If not, it would be a nice feature. Thank you so, so much for this extension. It is truly wonderful!

年多没见，过年回家了，开始几天没感觉。今天吃饭的时候，他说了一些话，看不起我现在的工作，然后我突然就清醒了：我已经大到明白，我是一个独立的人这个事实了，我要独自面对将来的风险了，没有人能帮的了我，也没有人真的明白你遭受的挫折，即使是亲人。</p> <p>事实上，大学毕业以后，就因为找工作以及谈恋爱受挫，就曾被我爸看不起，对我说过伤人的话，甚至动过手。我当时脸上还有痘痘，整个人很自卑。后来自学前端转行做了程序员，靠自己努力两年多，工资到了 2 万。工作也不是一封风顺，这其中冷暖只有我自己知道。不过这份工作应该是值得我爸去吹牛逼的，他也的确以我吹过牛逼。我们也淡忘了曾经不愉快的经历，我原谅他曾经那些伤人的话。</p> <p>今年的大行情是怎么样大家都知道，我被裁，又去到朋友的公司，月薪到了 3 万。父母不知道，以为我工资还是两万，我觉得没什么，2 万已经够他们自豪的了。结果今天吃饭，我爸突然提起老家同村的两个孩子在腾讯，年薪加起来上百万，然后又说人家多厉害，你怎么越来越差，今年年终奖都没有。真的，那瞬间，我很生气，随后，顿悟了开头那些话，现在我反而有点轻松了，我可以抛弃一部分亲情了，或者枷锁了。</p> <p>我不想告诉他们我现在月薪 3 万，因为还是达不到别人家的孩子那样，我笑笑回了句，我是比上不足比下有余。每当我劝自己别在意不开心的事的时候，我都不由自主的微笑。</p> <p>工作这么多年，做了那么多事，我是什么样的人，不是父母可以定义的，如果得不到认可，也没必要执着，逃离开吧，毕竟假期也快结束了。</p>   </details>     <p>     <a

还是忘清理缓存了，结果悲剧了，视频一打开，扑入眼帘的居然是之前看日本小电影视频的片段，虽然只有短短的 1 秒，但是正好是动作片最激烈最不可描述的那一幕，女友，她父母当时都看见了，那一刻，周围的空气恐怖的瞬间凝固了，空气中充满着无比尴尬的气氛。</p> <p>女友整个脸都黑了，我心脏剧烈跳动，大脑空白了差不多 5 秒后，冒出一句：这啥破软件，咋老蹦出乱七八糟的广告。稍微化解了一些尴尬的气氛。</p>

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Add a ChatGPT Plugin **Describe the solution you'd like** Would be create to have an integration with ChatGPT that turn ChatGPT conversation outputs into a presentation. I think this will take some kind of translation layer that takes common ChatGPT outputs and formats them to work well with slidev. **Describe alternatives you've considered** - attempted to do this manually but found it difficult to get ChatGPT to understand slidev's format - slidegpt.com seems like it may be an alternative but as of writing it is not functional
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, MemoryHighAction - cgroup systemd actions ### Component systemctl ### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe In discussion with ChatGPT he suggested me that there is something like this: ``` [Service] MemoryHigh=500M MemoryHighAction=/usr/bin/some_script.sh ``` But as I searched over systemd code base and documentation I found nothing like that. That feature would be a great addition in the universe of systemd. So to sum up, I would like to have an action when systemd service crosses over `MemoryHigh` bar. ### Describe the solution you'd like _No response_ ### Describe alternatives you've considered _No response_ ### The systemd version you checked that didn't have the feature you are asking for 252
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, error message upon clicking Ask ChatGPT Clicking Ask ChatGPT result in the following error: Error. Make sure you're running the server by following the instructions on https://github.com/gragland/chatgpt-chrome-extension. Also make sure you don't have an adblocker preventing requests to localhost:3000. Yes, running the server, logged in, and Ask ChatGPT is in the context menu.
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Freezes at end of responses Sometimes the Chatgpt program seemingly never gets the memo that ChatGPT has completed its response. If streaming is enabled, this results in the entire response being sent to the screen, but then no prompt for another input. If streaming is disabled, since the program never finds out the response is complete, it never prints it to the screen. In either case, if logging is enabled, the response never gets logged. The only thing you can do is to hit Ctrl+C to terminate the program. There should probably be a timeout similar to the "no response at all" timeout, triggered after a certain time with no data from ChatGPT after starting to receive a valid response. When this timeout triggers, the program should assume it's received all it's going to receive, and handle the situation as if it had received a complete response E.G. log it, render it if streaming is disabled, provide the next input prompt, etc.

</summary>     今年回老家过年，在家里住得简直不要太舒服。<br>首先，我老家在是县郊，离城区几公里，离几个高速口也是几公里，交通越来越便利，去往周边城市省会都在 2 小时左右。<br>其次，现在快递很给力，京东都能次日达，直接送到家，现在老家用的很多东西都是在网上购买的，在外打工买东西也几乎都是京东解决。<br>然后，我就产生了回老家自建一套，不想再去大城市卷的想法。<br>可是，问题来了，就是医疗卫生教育这两块成了短板，县高中倒是在省里很牛，但初中小学要解决的话又必须要在城里买房，要是农村也能解决教育问题就很好了，近些国家为了搞城市化，把农村教育是越搞越差。<br>总结，在农村交通慢慢改善的前提下，农村居住应该是很不错的，大城市的笼子真的住得很不舒服。

刷题的帖子，刚刚又刷到一贴，《<a href="https://www.v2ex.com/t/910741" rel="nofollow">刷算法题有感</a>》，在底下想评论，奈何写了太多，最后决定单独开贴，一吐为快。</p> <p>对<strong>码农</strong>来说，LeetCode 这种 OJ 适当刷刷能应付面试就得了，<strong>别太当真，除非你就是喜欢这玩意儿</strong>，本质上跟有人喜欢解数学题、有人喜欢写毛笔字、有人喜欢画漫画……等等等等没什么不同的话，那这个另算。</p> <p>可是，我相信<strong>发自内心喜欢这个的人终究是少数</strong>。大多数自诩对算法有热情的，无非是别有目的，也可以说是动机不纯，只是刚到了刷题的甜蜜点，自我催眠一下罢了。不然遇到难题想破脑袋都想不出来，那是真的打击积极性，不自我暗示一下根本坚持不下去。</p> <p>刷题只是为了过笔试找工作，这本身并没什么不对，<strong>进大厂多赚点钱嘛不寒碜，但这并不能称之为热爱</strong>。我始终认为，真正热爱算法的人，也一定会喜欢数学。因为<strong>算法的本质就是数学</strong>，解题时的思考过程也相差无几。不信你大可以去看看那些算法书，真较起真来是要用数学来证明算法的正确性和效率的。</p> <p>至于去讨论区看题解，发现各路高手贴出无比巧妙刁钻优雅简洁的解法，同时还附赠了简单的数学证明过程，当然会有 mind blown 时刻，然后相比之下自己就是个渣渣，就忍不住开始自我怀疑。</p> <p>然而，你跟那些高手比，就相当于你一个普通念书备战高考的，跟校田径队的体育特长生去比短跑长跑。你根本没花心思练过，某天心血来潮，看人家跑挺好，自己也想试试，结果跟着跑了两步，发现完全跟不上，然后说我靠这帮孙子跑太快了，我是不是体质不行没有天赋不适合跑步啊——大可不必如此。</p> <p>不说那些从初高中开始就玩竞赛的，毕竟人家可能根本瞧不上 LeetCode 这个平台的出题水平，哪怕是读了研才开始<strong>自学转码</strong>，只要下足功夫，也能做到 LeetCode 竞赛分数 2400 分左右——这是什么概念？ Top 0.6%。怎么做到的？先刷够 2500 道题再说。<strong>扪心自问，你做得到吗？</strong>先不论是否可行，只看主观能动性，你真的愿意付出大量的时间和精力在这上面吗？</p> <p>话说回来，刷题有没有用，要看你的目的是什么。如果像上面提到的那样，为了刷题过笔试找工作进大厂赚高薪，那肯定是有用，不然 LeetCode 不会火遍全球。但 LeetCode 刷得溜，并不代表你工程能力强，能写出易于维护、方便扩展的代码，或是能做出超炫酷的软件，也不代表你的算法造诣深，能像 Dijkstra 那样发明新的算法，同样不代表你能设计出一个数据库、编译器、网络协议或是操作系统，这些领域对算法确实有相当的要求，但刷题本身跟这些完全是两码事。</p> <p>抛开功利性的目的不谈，刷题本身对码农来说也是种思维和编程上的双重训练。能解难题，说明对某些<strong>明确了特定条件</strong>的问题，有较强的抽象能力。很多时候眼睁睁看着归类标签，明知道要用某一算法来解，读完了题都不知道从哪开始下手。另外题解代码能同时做到“高效、优雅、简洁、易读”，说明你比较熟悉某一门编程语言，能用一些语法糖和语言特定的“奇技淫巧”，以及在工程上至少某一局部的代码，比如明确了输入输出的某个 util 函数，能写得比较优质。</p> <p>君不见有太多<strong>基本编程素养不过关</strong>的码农，为了解决一个很简单的功能，循环嵌套了一层又一层，却根本不知道一个递归就能简洁明了地搞定。对于这样的选手，简单刷几十道题就会有明显进步，那刷题肯定是有用的。</p> <p>再简单推荐两个我的偶像，LeetCode 上比较老的题的讨论区很容易找到 <a href="https://leetcode.com/stefanpochmann/" rel="nofollow">Stefan</a>，这位好几个语言都玩得贼溜，但很久不更新了，大概对他来说解题只是娱乐的一种吧，感兴趣的可以去他的上古个人博客看了解更多。新题则是国人之光 <a href="https://leetcode.com/lee215/" rel="nofollow">Lee215</a>，<del>我愿称之为 LeetCode 界的 Faker （不是）</del>，基本每个题解都会有 C++/Java/Python 三种写法。国服大佬也很多，但我只刷过美服，就不太了解了。</p> <p>虽然可能没人感兴趣，但都写了这么多，就干脆再简单聊下自己。我刷题坚持刷了一年多，每天 996 下班回家之后还开机刷道题，365 天风雨无阻毫无例外，当时自我感动得不行，最后也只是拿了个 LeetCode 的 Annual Medal 2021 徽章而已，依然菜得抠脚。到目前不刷题也已经快一年了，因为意识到在软件工程领域，无论是 Web 前后端还是别的什么，都还有更多有趣的东西可以去探索把玩。同时也是因为根本没可能去 FAANG 或是 GAMAM ，whatever ，就看开了。</p> <p>最后感谢各位花时间来看我这一时兴起的水贴，欢迎各路大佬拍砖指教，也欢迎像我一样曾经虽菜但肝的小伙伴来讨论。</p>   </details>     <p>     <a href="https://www.v2ex.com/t/910785">41 comments</a> by <a

<p>迷茫的说不清学到什么，能做了什么。一个英语很差，认为英语不需要（做技术英语阅读能力很有必要）。一个很精干的孩子找专业方面工作没找到，后来考了公务员。 一个是他母亲坚持要他改行，说写软件太累身体。但愿上大学选专业时她坚持不让选 CS 。</p> <p>大学四年浪费了。对个人家庭是非常的损失。都不仅是学费损失问题，是华年流失，走弯路，还造成焦虑。很值得避免。所以想了解一些数据：</p>

<details>     <summary>       <strong>求推荐一款 MikroTik 下的有线主路由</strong>     </summary>     <h3>现状</h3> <p>外网千兆，淘了 2 个红米 AX6 准备用来组 mesh 的，不过后来其中 1 个被我刷了 openwrt 闭源的 qsdk ，无线信号不怎么行，虽然比开源驱动好一些，但是实际用起来还是会偶发问题，现在决定换成 ros 主路由(求稳，然后加一些 ddns wg 等 ros 自带的插件)+openwrt 旁路由(更多插件)，openwrt 旁路由已用 pve 虚拟一个出来，现在是 ros 主路由的选择，准备选一个作有线主路由，然后把红米 ax6 刷回原厂当 ap 。</p> <hr> <h3>需求</h3> <p>带机量：现在家里设备应该有 30 左右，以后考虑希望能支持到 50+。</p> <p>价格：&lt;1500</p> <p>网口：4 个即可，多了也用不到，如果能有万兆口更好了，没有也无所谓。</p> <hr> <h3>选项</h3> <p>x86 软路由：j4125+螃蟹 8125b 2.5G ，前期在坛子里面搜资料，感觉没必要用软路由，查资料看到不少人说小包转发不如专门的硬件设备。</p> <p>MikroTik 硬路由：B750GR3 、hAP ac2 、4011 、5009 、CCR1016 ，B750GR3 性能够带 50+设备嘛，hAP ac2 是不是都可以把红米 ax6 卖了，看它自带 ap 的，4011 5009 现在价格有点高了，mips 比 arm 的是不是好一些，B750GR3 是 mips 的，hAP ac2 是 arm 的</p> <hr> <h3>结果</h3> <p>目前看 hAP ac2 不支持 hwoffload ，nat 性能不行，hAP ac2 可以 pass 了</p>   </details>     <p>     <a href="https://www.v2ex.com/t/910842">23

作为测试机用，过年的时候我妈好奇用了一下，升降前置摄像头的设计不错，再加上给家里人、同学和其他人视频的时候美颜增亮效果让我妈显得年轻不少，我妈非常开心，问能不能先用着，我查了一下网上 nex3s 的价格，小四千块了，感觉还不如加点钱买个新的手机，毕竟 nex3s 也是旧款了。<br><br>我妈的使用习惯：自己经营一个小柜台，平常接打客户电话，最常用的软件是微信，刷刷短视频啥的，看看新闻短片，不玩游戏，偶尔听听歌。买新衣服了喜欢拍拍照，和老同学、亲戚视频一下聊天。出去转圈的时候喜欢拍个照啥的作为留念。不会用复杂的软件，微信也是调成最大字看<br><br>我自己感觉的刚性需求是：<br>1.安卓厂商的旗舰系列型号<br>2.拍照要好，特别是前置摄像头，给别人视频的时候看起来年轻一些<br>3.信号要好，我妈经营个小店，不能让顾客联系不上，我妈是中国移动卡<br><br>加分需求：<br>1.非曲面屏、折叠屏、翻转屏，容易误触，玩不转，最好是直板手机<br>2.电池容量大，耐使，最好有快充，快充功率大小不限，有时候我妈晚上忘了充电就要去忙，早上最好冲一会儿不耽误上午接打电话和回微信<br>3.厂家的 UI 交互设计好一些，整体体验要好，我妈不太会玩太复杂的设置操作，最好是我收到手机给她设置好，她以后就一劳永逸<br>4.机身坚固性好一些，不要太薄的手机，但也不要太沉太厚<br><br>有没有大佬能帮忙参考一下的，预算 1W 以下都行，想买个能用四五年不卡的。看我妈越来越老了，年轻的时候条件不允许，什么都只能将就，这年龄大了不能再将就了。跪求各位大佬帮忙了~   </details>

  </p>   <details>     <summary>       <strong>「🎉福利送码」Wins - 极简的窗口管理工具</strong>     </summary>     <p>Hello👋  MacApp 分享频道和 V 站的小伙伴们，我是 Wins 的主要开发者，非常高兴能有机会在这里和你们见面，这真是 Wins 的幸运。</p> <p>如你所知 macOS 的窗口管理非常混乱，纵使已经到了 macOS 13 Ventura ，Apple 提供了 Stage Manager, 但很多人依然不喜欢这个功能。有许多软件尝试解决这个问题，但是总不能让我满意，作为一个数字极简主义者和一个果粉，怀揣着对于 Apple 的信仰，我们尝试以 Apple 的产品思维开发了 Wins 。</p> <p>下面介绍 Wins 的主要功能和特点。</p> <hr> <h2>动画效果</h2> <p>Apple 的产品最善于做符合人类直觉的动画效果，"为软件赋予生命就让软件动起来" Wins 提供了分屏预览动画，我们认为动画是软件的灵魂。</p> <h2>悬浮分屏</h2> <p>Wins 预设好了常用的分屏布局，当你拖动一个窗口时，在顶部会展示出悬浮分屏面板，当你拖动窗口到悬浮分屏后，可以快速按照对应的布局调整窗口。</p> <p>![分屏 1.jpeg]( <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ClassmateShen/image/main/%E5%88%86%E5%B1%8F" rel="nofollow">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ClassmateShen/image/main/分屏</a> 1.jpeg)</p> <h2>快速分屏</h2> <p>只需要将窗口快速拖动到屏幕边缘，即可触发分屏，这是最简单和符合普通人直觉的操作逻辑。</p> <p><img alt="分屏动画.gif" class="embedded_image" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" rel="noreferrer" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ClassmateShen/image/main/%E5%88%86%E5%B1%8F%E5%8A%A8%E7%94%BB.gif"></p> <h2>系统级集成</h2> <p>Wins 直接集成在系统设置 App 中，没有额外的窗口，不会出现在 Dock 栏， 也不会占用你宝贵的 Menu Bar 。Wins 会像系统功能一样，为 macOS 做窗口管理的能力增强。</p> <p><img alt="settings.png" class="embedded_image" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" rel="noreferrer" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ClassmateShen/image/main/settings.png"></p> <h2>一键隐藏全部窗口</h2> <p>当你沉浸在工作学习中时，会突然发现开启的窗口太多了，简直太凌乱了，这时候可以使用 Wins 一键最小化所有窗口，让你回到熟悉的桌面。</p> <p><img alt="hidden_all_windows_zh.gif" class="embedded_image" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" rel="noreferrer" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ClassmateShen/image/main/hidden_all_windows_zh.gif"></p> <p>视频： <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ClassmateShen/image/main/hidden_all_windows_zh.mp4" rel="nofollow">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ClassmateShen/image/main/hidden_all_windows_zh.mp4</a></p> <h2>摇晃窗口隐藏其他窗口</h2> <p>同样，你现在开启了很多窗口，这时候你只想聚焦在当前的窗口上，想把其他窗口都最小化。你可以在 Wins 中开启这一功能，然后抖动一下当前窗口，其他的窗口都会自动隐藏。</p> <p><img alt="shakeToHideOthers.gif" class="embedded_image" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" rel="noreferrer" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ClassmateShen/image/main/shakeToHideOthers.gif"></p> <p>视频： <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ClassmateShen/image/main/shakeToHideOthers.mp4" rel="nofollow">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ClassmateShen/image/main/shakeToHideOthers.mp4</a></p> <h2>低功耗</h2> <p>我们认为 Wins 要常驻进程，跟随 Mac 启动，不能为系统造成额外负担，让用户有心理焦虑。 所以我们非常在意功耗，内存占用低于 30M ，CPU 使用率低于 10%，大多数情况仅占用 0.1%。</p> <p><img alt="HighEfficiency1.png" class="embedded_image" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" rel="noreferrer" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ClassmateShen/image/main/HighEfficiency1.png"></p> <hr> <h2>总结</h2> <p>这就是 Wins 当下的主要功能，我们想做一个简单易用、界面统一、没有存在感、符合人类直觉、超低功耗.....</p> <p>Wins 是一个很新的软件，我们是一个很小的团队，但是我们对它的期望很高，有太多的思绪飞扬和激动人心的功能在我们的规划当中，今年可能无法全部完成，但是明年一定可以，无论 Wins 卖的怎么样，我们都会将那些用户和我们所期待的功能带给大家，因为我们心中充满了对于软件的热爱❤️‍🔥。</p> <hr> <h2>下载&amp;福利</h2> <p>最后就是下载+福利啦！</p> <p>如果有小伙伴还有其他的需求，在日常的使用过程中，不趁手的，可通过直接在下方留言评论，Wins 将持续迭代优化这块，争取做到 macOS 分屏软件中的翘楚。</p> <p>当然 Wins 都来网站了，老规矩，还是要送福利啦！在底下评论区留下你和 Wins 的故事，内容包括但不限于<code>对软件的评价</code>、<code>对软件的意见和建议</code>、<code>bug

年的，比较有感觉，然后开始追了，到了最后妹子父母堂哥堂姐全都对我比较满意（听我姑姑说的），但是追了七八天出去吃饭看电影剧本杀啥的都玩了，到了大年三十那天妹子说不想结婚，只想玩玩，只能作罢。然后大年初二见了另一个妹子，看完后我对爸妈说没感觉，我妈说我没资格挑，赶紧去追，让我约她出来玩，但是妹子微信说只想微信聊聊，我把情况说了我妈还是让我去她家玩，我就受不了开车直接回深圳了。哎，我只想愉快的过个好年，父母说的我都尽量满足，但是他们太着急了也没啥好结果，现在闹得我心里空落落的</p>

年在上海外企做会计，父母在老家开五金店，妹子性格挺开朗，长像也不错，主动给我端茶剥橘子，倒是我显得有些紧张跟尴尬，她父母也是挺实在的人，只要求女儿的对象人品好就行，而且不希望女儿嫁外地，其他的没有说太多，然后我就加了妹子微信。<br>     春节期间只跟她在微信中互动，对方也回复的挺热情，她朋友圈从三天可见变成半年可见，我鼓起勇气跟她约好下周末见面，但怕到时见面紧张的不讲啥，语无伦次的会给对方留下不好的印象！<br>    请过来人帮小弟出出意见，见面去什么地方玩，聊些啥不冷场，各个方面的都行！谢谢了！   </details>     <p>     <a

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, !smurf | СhatGPT #174 The solution I see, and it will be relevant, is to integrate with ChatGPT myself, where it will respond to this command. People will know that this is the machine that counts and will not think that the bot is accusing someone or telling the truth. I think it will be interesting. ChatGPT I think Nature Prophet is a smurf. The chance of this is 87%. Hm.... Also you can name it !aismurf, !smufAI or just !smurf ![зображення](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91318807/216614145-d78c36e9-5b04-41af-b305-ac11aed62505.png)

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Auto-disable Search on the web Could a new switch be added to auto-disable Search on the web ?  This plugin is fantastic for utilizing CHATGPT for getting the latest data and answering questions, but often times after searching for results, I forget to close the Search on the web and continue using CHATGPT for other Q&A.  Thank you for your hard work and making CHATGPT even better!
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Too many requests. ChatGPTAPI error 429 Currently following the instructions to login using the recommended Autologin. I click login, chrome opens and I enter my credentials. I successfully login and the chrome window minimizes. When I try asking chatgpt a question using the extension, I keep getting "Too many requests. (HTTP 429 Too Many Requests) ChatGPTAPI error 429" Although, if I open the minimized chrome window, I can successfully ask chatgpt questions. Is this a known issue?

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Use ChatGPT API Key ### Description OpenAI has API Support where authentication is performed with an API Key. This form of authentication and interaction would actually be better than using Email Address and Password Credentials, especially since OpenAI supports OAuth with Google, thus eliminating users who use this auth method from using this extension.  https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Unable to access ChatGPT from this openai package I am trying to get ChatGPT model from list of OpenAI models using following code. But I can not find the ChatGPT in the list.

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, HTML in prompts is rendered instead of being escaped I asked ChatGPT this question: > Semantically, if I'm presenting a group of checkboxes, should I present them as `<ul><li><label><input type="checkbox"/></label></li></ul>`? Is presenting them as a list important, or should I just do the checkboxes with their labels? When I sent the question, the extension replaced my code with an HTML checkbox. The same happens when I put other bits of HTML in my questions. Notably, ChatGPT's responses are properly escaped instead of being rendered as HTML--probably because they're enclosed in a triple-backtick (\`\`\`) instead of a single backtick (\`).

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Feature request: Detailed summaries It might be worth having an in-between mode where the full text takes too long to read, but the summary is too short to give substantive detail to really understand what the article is trying to say. I would love to have something which summarizes, but in detail, similar to a human who is skilled at taking notes, where the relevant parts are put down.  Ideally this would be filtered by the audience who is reading the detailed summaries. Currently I'm finding the summaries by ChatGPT delete a lot of important information which makes the summary kind of useless because I have to read it anyway to really get the point of what it is saying. Basically high level summaries are only helpful in some limited use cases. I am not sure if this is possible in what you have created but it is an idea.

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Question: Why dead-letter-exchange configuration is shared in RabbitCommonProperties?

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Integrating LLMs into search (link prediction, top-site summarization, stable diffusion images, academic articles) There are plenty of amazing solutions for using large language models (LLMs) to help with searching. For sake of compressing this request, I'll point out four kinds of them that I want in a modern search engine: - [Metaphor systems](https://metaphor.systems) has a working beta which is trained to _predict links based on prompts._ This is much more like a classic search engine, except, my god, it already has been so much better at getting useful articles than any single search engine has been for my searches. - [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/), [KOMO](https://komo.ai/), and [Uminal](https://www.uminal.com/) have created chat bots that take any text sent to them, forward it to a search engine, pick the top x resulting sites, and feed them through an LLM that summarizes them. They all have been fantastic for cutting through the clutter that I'm so used to having to sift through on the internet and getting exactly the answer I want. The first two include citations, links to the sites where they got the facts in their answers from, which is amazing. Uminal may be the most useful to us though, as I'm aware the owner is considering open-sourcing it (!) - Though I know there are many, [Lexica](https://lexica.art) is the longest-standing AI image search engine I know of. - [Elicit](https://elicit.org/) is the best solution I know of today for searching scholarly articles using AI, and it's fantastic. It would be great if we could implement a menu on the side for link-prediction and top-site summarizing LLMs like those outlined. Perhaps stable-diffusion image and AI-based academic article searchers could be implemented as engines, or perhaps they ought to have their own tabs? If there isn't an API available, is it a possibility to have a headless browser scrape a response page? Maybe it would be a good idea to cache responses to eliminate unnecessary duplicate requests to these aforementioned free providers? I'm aware of #2009, but I don't think with these offerings that already exist we should use ChatGPT to answer prompts directly, though that is certainly an option (!) I'd be happy to work on this here if we think that this is the way forward. Please give input if you know of better ways of achieving this right now! cheers, alex ---- Related: - https://github.com/searxng/searxng/issues/2008 - https://github.com/searxng/searxng/issues/2273

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, AI Helper for learning paths Add a feature to the AI helper plugin, in the form of an additional icon in the learning path list's actions toolbar. Show a form that asks for a topic, a number of chapters, a length (in words) for each chapter. Ask ChatGPT for the following: `Generate the table of contents of a course in [$courseLanguage] in [$chaptersCount] or less chapters on the topic of "[$topic]" in the CSV format, with the chapter number in the first column and the chapter title in the second column.`. This will return a CSV with the chapters. Prepare this as the structure for a new learning path in Chamilo: create one learning path of title [$topic], then create one empty document (in a flat learning path structure) for each chapter with the following content: ``` <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head>   <title>La science de la navigation spatiale</title>   <meta charset="utf-8"> </head> <body>   PLACEHOLDER </body> </html> ``` Then, for each chapter, make an additional request: `In the context of "[$topic]", generate a document with HTML tags in [$courseLanguage] with [$wordsCount] words of content or less, about "[$chapterTitle]"`. With the results, replace the `PLACEHOLDER` in the document created previously. Make the learning path invisible by default (the teacher needs to review it before students can access it) and send the teacher to the learning path edition view. Do not offer textarea review during the creation process like we do in the Aiken import section. Just generate the documents.
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Minor still 'thinking...' bug after chatGPT response. I am seeing a minor bug where the chatGPT response indicator shows it is still 'thinking' even after it has fully generated the full response.  This can shave off time cumulatively out of your workflow as you wait for full response before attempting the next one.  See screenshot on the link: [screenshot - still thinking after response](https://prnt.sc/sxkly3vOMfDb)

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Using with proprietary code? Hi! I'm worried about proprietary of code. How does it do stuff at the backend level? Does it try to git pull, and if so, how will that work for proxy-protected (or private organizations)? Does it use ChatGPT API ? If so, doesn't ChatGPT has access to the code as-well? Cool tool though!

<details>     <summary>       <strong>年过四十，人生有了阶段性困惑</strong>     </summary>     一、关于死亡的困惑<br>若是晚生 500 年，人类是不是就可以彻底摆脱疾病和死亡了？<br>如果是的话，感觉自己活在这个时代有点亏<br>但也许 500 年后我们也可能像《三体》书中某个脑袋一样陷入生不如死、永远活在虚拟地狱中的悲惨境地<br>《怕死：人类行为的驱动力》一书中认为死亡能推动整个人类的进化，死亡从宏观来看对人类族群是有好处的<br>但作为一个个体，一个独立意识，谁甘心永远消逝？<br>心理学中有一个近端防御和远端防御的概念，我想我这种情况是不是远端防御没建设好？<br>是否真的只能求助于宗教才能获得内心的安宁？<br>小结：<br>1.长生不死求而不得，时刻恐惧绝望<br>2.担心未来人类虽然实现了永生却失去自由甚至因此灭绝，实际还是给自己找一个理由说服自己死亡并不是坏事<br><br>二、关于事业的困惑<br>当青春不再，俗事缠身，父母逐年衰老，等父母百年之后，人生将再无来处只剩归途，一想到这些，瞬间就失去了奋斗的原动力<br>闲暇之余经常列张表格分析自己拥有的资产，感觉这辈子温饱该是不愁了，继续工作只是为了对他人负责<br>年轻时拿命换钱，也不知道再过几年身体是否会出大毛病，往后余生不想再过 996 的生活，可选的事业方向已经不多了<br>盛稻和夫那种以工作为信仰的道理咱实在理解不能，能有一份愉快、稳定的工作环境现阶段咱也就满足了<br>人在物质上的生存所需只需很少的金钱就能满足，据所说古代人的幸福感不比现代人弱？如果往后余生追求的只是一种精神上的满足，那么工作的意义是什么呢？<br>有人说当你陷入职业倦怠期，最好的办法就是更加努力的工作？<br>还有人说人生就得不断尝试新事物，总会找到方向，你要主动跳出舒适区、要锻炼延迟满足、要勇敢走向未知领域.......可真这样做了，最后有几人能成功？<br>如果说结果不重要只要有过程就好，那最后当你真的失败了，会不会悔恨自己玩脱了？会不会到头来觉得平凡的人生才更宝贵？<br>夜深人寂，也会纠结：要不再拼一拼，这辈子也来个阶层越迁？然后又深入思考觉得，越迁之后呢，再继续越迁吗？向上爬的过程中还能不能停下来？奋斗的过程中付出的代价会有哪些？<br>做出一份事业，除了选对赛道，还在于想清楚做事业的目标是什么，是钱吗？是权吗？造福社会吗？为 Z 华之崛起而工作？或者只为养家糊口？对我来说目前目标不清晰，很难付诸于行动；<br>有些强人每天像打了鸡血一样的工作我觉得很多时候是周围环境在推着他们前进，做事情到一定程度，不进则退，那时候能有一点独立思考的时间都是奢望。<br>小结：在舒适区纠结、拖延、享受，也许哪天会因冲动而改变现状，也许人生也就这样了。<br><br>三、关于婚姻的困惑<br>世道在变，身边朋友们的离婚率我感觉有 50%以上了，特别是 7 年之痒那几年<br>男人身体出轨女人多半能忍，男人身心都出轨了，女人多半还是要离的<br>这个社会对男人的诱惑特别多，那些没有离婚的，我认为只是诱惑还不到位罢了<br>如果选择做一名快乐的宅男是不是更安全？就让艾薇儿来控制荷尔蒙，让 1024 不停的索取精气神，一个贤者是不是就没有条件出轨了？远离了社会诱惑，夫妻自然和睦？<br>婚姻问题很复杂，还记得《幸福关系的 7 段旅程》一书中把婚姻（亲密关系）分成了 6 个阶段，每个阶段听起来都有一定的道理，但外国人的书适合国情么？在中国，我觉得婚姻问题主要就是经济问题<br>居安思危（杞人忧天）的想：如果以后生意失败破产了婚姻还能维持吗？若再惨一点坐牢了呢？若夫妻一方大病需要人长期照顾呢？人说久病床前无孝子更何况夫妻；现在安稳的生活在未来随时会被人生中各类风险所击破，你有信心能一辈子经营好婚姻吗？<br>如果保持这种如履薄冰的的心态来经营婚姻，那你还能全身心的享受婚姻生活吗？可要是做个傻白甜，不去想那么多就专注眼前过好当下，当风险来临时没有预案应对真的能行么？<br>有个友人告诉我：夫妻双方就像一个房子中最重要的两根粱，必须保持一样长短，任意一边长了、短了，房子都会垮，从稳定婚姻的角度来说，你不能进步得太快，也不能比对方退步得太多，否则要么出轨，要么活在痛苦之中。有道理吗？<br>小结：中年人没有真正的爱情，如果有，多半是出轨了。<br><br>四、关于后代的困惑<br>生个娃，让他在童年时拼命学习，在年轻时拼命工作，老了受病痛折磨，最后一捧尘土结束，让孩子像我们这样活一辈子，考虑过他本人的感受么？<br>还记得关军《无后为大》那本书中引用了古人一首诗，我感同身受：<br>我昔未生时，冥冥无所知。<br>天公强生我，生我复何为？ <br>无衣使我寒，无食使我饥。<br>还你天公我，还我未生时。 <br>虽然无法想像战争时期出生的人们在临死前对人生是怎样一种体验，但就说和平时期房奴们 996 的福报生活，还有生老病死大恐怖的晚年，有多少人有勇气坦然面对？<br>来到这个人世间由不得我们控制，但至少我们能控制要不要让后代来到这个世界。<br>不是每一个父母都是合格的，我们真的有能力给予孩子一个幸福的人生吗？社会上只管生不管养的事还少吗？<br>不是每一个学校都是合格的，教育界历来西风压东风，当你选不到一个好学校，真会把人搞得中风<br>一想到这些我就没信心，不想让下一代面对这些风险。<br>要不丁克吧，可丁克也不是那么好当的，社会压力不说，就双方老人的观念中，能轻易接受断子绝孙的将来？<br>我有时候想，子女选择丁克其实对老人是有好处的吧？子女会给老人更多陪伴，经济上也更加宽裕，相对于那些操劳一辈子还要继续带孙子的同龄人，老人会有更多时间来享受人生？<br>丁克晚年生活就真的注定凄惨？不光没了含饴弄孙的乐趣，也没了养儿防老的保障？<br>说到“养儿防老”这个伪命题，如果父母出于养老的心态去投资一个小孩让其长大成人，再依托孝道这样的东西来保证投资回报，几千年来，古人是这样做的，现代人依旧如此，能说有问题吗？孝治天下，从某种意义上来讲延续到今天依然存在。<br>养儿啃老也是一个严峻的问题，随着教育的普及，国内越来越多人选择丁克，有的人是被迫丁，有人是自愿丁，中国人口出生率越来越低<br>在古代（甚至改开几十年前），你若不生小孩晚年真可能就无法存活，现在么，年轻人终于可以有所选择，你看都在用肚皮投票<br>我曾经问过自己一个扎心的问题：父母为什么生了你？是为了爱吗？是社会风俗吗？这个问题我其实不太想知道答案。<br>以上，就写到这里吧，再写就反人类了，毕竟人类要延续，祖国要复兴，大家为国添丁吧。

pro ，配备 10G 速率万兆网口，打算购买三台戴尔 U2723QX 显示器，苹果无线键鼠等装备，作为未来 5 年内视频剪辑工作主力装备，我有一个硬性要求：必须保证三台显示器均显示 4k 分辨率及 60 赫兹刷新率，并且分别显示出不同的画面内容。<br>目前苹果官网查询 m2pro 最多可接三台显示器，分别是接两个雷雳 4 口和一个 HDMI 口，但是这样会占用 Mac mini 的 HDMI 接口，我不想占用 HDMI ，将来想给 Mac mini 配一个回音壁音响，到时候可能会用到这个接口。目前我想到一个新的连接方式，不知道是否可行，特此请教！<br>假设三台显示器分别命名为左显、中显、右显，用 DP 线以菊花链的串联方式连接中显和右显，然后用 typec 线连接中显和 Mac mini 中的一个雷雳 4 口；左显先用 typec 线连接 Mac mini 中的另一个雷雳 4 口，再用 DP 线连接到 windows 电脑的 1050ti 显卡的 DP 接口实现同时访问两台电脑，最终这样连接，可以省下 Mac mini 的 HDMI 口。<br>现在我的问题是，Mac mini 的一个雷雳 4 口能否带动起两台串联起来的中显和右显？能否都显示 4k 分辨率及 60 赫兹刷新率？其中右显能否设置为扩展屏以显示不同的画面？还有我的 Mac mini 10G 网口要接 nas 实现万兆速率读取数据，所以我还需要利用 U2723QX 的网口接交换机实现 Mac mini 连网，那么应该接串联的哪一台显示器？还有接 windows 电脑的左显然后又接 Mac mini 的另一个雷雳 4 口，能否实现两台主机的画面都是 4k 分辨率及 60 赫兹刷新率显示？<br>内容篇幅有些长，是为了详细描述我的问题，恳请各位大佬解答，谢谢！   </details>     <p>

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Layout problem caused by model selection box in chatGPT Plus is blocking pagination buttons. I am having an issue with chatGPT Plus. When I activate it, a model selection box appears at the top of the screen, which causes a layout problem. The selection box blocks the view of the pagination buttons located under the prompt. This makes it difficult for me to use the feature. Could you please fix this issue so that the prompt and pagination buttons are visible at the same time? Thank you. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31281915/218358798-b41473ee-2d94-45e4-872e-4fb00bdba614.png)

ISSUE,  DISCARDED,  Slow Response and Timeout Error when using ChatGPT in Visual Studio Code  Dear Author, I hope this message finds you well. I have been using your ChatGPT extension for Visual Studio Code for the past few days, and initially, it was working great with fast responses. However, suddenly the extension started to respond very slowly, and eventually, I received a timeout error. I have checked my network connection and I am confident that it is not an issue with my network. I have also compared my experience with the official ChatGPT web page, and it is working perfectly fine. Upon reviewing the Visual Studio Code developer logs, I found the following error message: "ChatGPT error 404" and "TimeoutError: ChatGPT timed out waiting for response". I would greatly appreciate it if you could help me resolve this issue. Let me know if there is any additional information that I can provide to assist with troubleshooting. Thank you for your time and effort in creating this extension. Best regards, nothing

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Unfinished response --> UI keeps "thinking" - no way to abort Asked chatgpt a question, it kept on polling. Might be due to chatgpt being overloaded. Is it a possibility to manually abort the generation of an answer and re init? Only way to do it RN is close VSCode & reopen for me.
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, What's the workaround for "ChatGPT is at capacity" feature? First of all, thanks for creating an app that helps using ChatGPT.  One of the features listed on the Readme says "chatgpt is at capacity" workaround", however, I didn't see how I could access it.  Even if I am a plus subscriber, when I get a login link and click, it directs me to the browser instead of the app. In other words, I can't use ChatGPT with this app when OpenAI is at capacity.
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Issue with page layout using extension Hi, I'm having an issue with the page layout while using this extension. It appears that the added `div` with information about the extension is breaking the bottom part of the page layout, which is then covering some parts of ChatGPT responses and the appearance of the extension itself (`Search on the web` button). ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56279952/219114610-65dc0ef1-d1a8-4591-9491-bbb7f43457f0.png) After some troubleshooting with the developer tools, I found that deleting the info box fixes the problem, and it seems to work as intended. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56279952/219114966-122440dc-6927-4de6-a737-4a67057e53fa.png) Browser: Brave Nightly, Edge (ver. 110.0.1587.46) ChatGPT variant: PLUS Display: 1080p and 2560x1440 Dev tools logs are empty.
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Request to include ChatGPT in Visual Studio Code for enhanced debugging and efficient coding <!-- ⚠️⚠️ Do Not Delete This! feature_request_template ⚠️⚠️ --> <!-- Please read our Rules of Conduct: https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/ --> <!-- Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates. --> <!-- Describe the feature you'd like. --> I am writing to express my interest in the potential inclusion of ChatGPT in Visual Studio Code. As a user of Visual Studio Code and a professional developer, I have found that ChatGPT has the potential to revolutionize the way we debug and write code, by providing a more efficient and effective way to handle coding issues and improve overall productivity. ChatGPT is a sophisticated language model that has been trained on vast amounts of text data, including scientific research and technical documents. It has been designed to generate human-like responses to complex queries, making it an excellent tool for debugging and coding. ChatGPT can help to identify coding errors, suggest code solutions, and provide explanations for code-related issues. With its advanced language processing capabilities, ChatGPT can easily parse and understand code syntax, enabling it to provide intelligent and context-specific suggestions. Integrating ChatGPT into Visual Studio Code will provide developers with a powerful tool for enhancing their productivity and code quality. The use of ChatGPT can reduce the time spent on debugging, as it can quickly and accurately identify issues and provide possible solutions. By enabling developers to write better code, ChatGPT can also help to reduce the likelihood of errors and bugs in the code, leading to more efficient and reliable software applications. Moreover, as Microsoft is a leader in the technology industry, the inclusion of ChatGPT in Visual Studio Code would set a new standard for the industry and demonstrate a commitment to improving the development process for all developers. In conclusion, I strongly recommend the integration of ChatGPT into Visual Studio Code. This innovative technology has the potential to revolutionize the way developers work, enabling them to be more efficient, productive, and successful in their projects. I am confident that this collaboration will be a significant milestone in the development of the software industry. Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, Ehidiamen Omonjahio
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Support acheong08's v1 browserless API to use the real ChatGPT model ### Describe the feature The reverse proxy method by `@waylaidwanderer` has recently been patched by OpenAI, which makes using the real ChatGPT model with a browserless API impossible. However, `@acheong08` has implemented a proxy server that allows users to bypass Cloudflare protection and use ChatGPT [through his v1 API](https://github.com/acheong08/ChatGPT#v1-standard-chatgpt). While the API is different from the official API, it is still functional. Can you consider supporting `@acheong08`'s v1 API in this project?
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, "That Model Does not exist" when select chatGPT ## When I tried to use chatGPT it showed me this message ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82967045/219787000-73a51200-9863-4313-8f4e-70c803fcab39.png) 
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Is it possible to maintain context using the "quick response" method? I'm not sure if this is possible, but an option to maintain memory/context when using the 'quick response' method would allow quick contextual follow-ups without having to get into the chatgpt application.  I like to use chatgpt as a terminal side-kick and this would at least be valuable for my usecase.

说，默念社会主义核心价值观（富强民煮之类...），我听到之后不知所措。虽然对方性格和条件和我很合适，但是我不是那爱 party 的人，俗称觉醒了，也就是粉红嘴里的 50 万。我怕以后交往期间因为这个吵架，甚至发生更严重的事情。 请教各位这种情况该怎么办，尽量避免说到这些问题还是不要再发展了</p>   </details>     <p>     <a

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Add linkml stackoverflow tag to documentation **Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.** Until today 2023-02-20 there seem to have been no stackoverflow questions related to linkml. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75508779/how-do-i-add-a-class-to-a-schemadefinition-in-linkml might be the first one. I asked ChatGPT for an explanation **explain why adding a stackoverflow link to the github project linkml might be a good idea/feature request** and I think the response is adequate: Adding a Stack Overflow link to the GitHub project for LinkML can be a useful feature request for several reasons: -    Better support: By providing a direct link to a Stack Overflow page dedicated to questions about the LinkML project, users can easily find answers to their questions, get help with issues they are facing, and contribute to the community by providing answers to other users' questions. This can help improve the overall support for the project and make it easier for new users to get started. -   Community building: Creating a dedicated space on Stack Overflow for LinkML can help build a community around the project. This can encourage collaboration, improve the quality of the project, and help build a network of developers and users who are passionate about the project. -    Documentation improvement: Stack Overflow pages can serve as a useful source of documentation for the project. By creating a dedicated space on Stack Overflow, users can share examples, code snippets, and other resources related to the project. This can help improve the quality of the documentation and make it more accessible to users. Overall, adding a Stack Overflow link to the GitHub project for LinkML can help improve the support, community, and documentation for the project, making it easier for users to get started and contribute to the project. **Describe the solution you'd like** [add https://stackoverflow.com/tags/linkml link to documentation](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/linkml) **How important is this feature?** Select from the options below: • Low - it's an enhancement but not crucial for work **When will use cases depending on this become relevant?** Select from the options below: • Short-term - 2-4 weeks **Additional context** Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. 
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Website translation doesn't translate content I was having a look at ur website because #Twitter and realised that when you click the "FR" option in the bottom right menu, the blog posts themselves aren't translated (for example https://kio.dev/fr/work/kio.dev). Not sure if intentional or not, but thought I'd make you aware, as it took me some time to realise what was happening and it felt like it wasn't working at first.ç Since it uses ChatGPT for the rest (I think?) then it might be worth adding to that :) 
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Exceeded Current Quota I started the project locally, and successfully got it set up. But when I try to use gpt, here's what I get ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79152648/220172288-e5ede84e-bd68-4793-91c6-224f4254d91a.png) I don't even use ChatGPT so often that it should show me the error *Exceeded Current Quota*. Kindly help me out Regards Sam Varghese
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Allow chatGPT to formulate search query itself I am a fan of the concept behind this extension, however, I believe there is room for improvement. It would be great if the extension could allow chatGPT to formulate web queries by using a syntax like "search: query".  This way, chatGPT could automate the process of searching for information on the web. From my testing with a simple script, I have found that this approach leads to better results compared to when the search query is always the same as the initial query from chatGPT.
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, url info not importing via QR vCard Here is the code I used. The contact1.png works, and when I use "Android Lens", it asks to save the info, but it does not import the website url info: I have not tested it on iPhone.  import segno from segno import helpers vcard = segno.helpers.make_vcard(     name='Pie;Rasberry',     displayname='Rasberry Pie',     # email can be multiple values, seperated by commas or make ['xx@gsomeemail.com','xg@someother.com']     email=('rpie.@some.com'),     url =[         'https://www.amazon.com',         'https://www.google.com',     ],     phone='+1111111111',     # extra items that can be used per testing - originated by chatgpt          title = 'Boss',     org = 'MyBiz-NotYours',      ) img = vcard.to_pil(scale=6, dark="#FF7D92").rotate(45, expand=True) img.save('contact1.png')

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, [PROPOSAL] - Content is: Using ChatGPT to augment your intelligence as a developer   [ ] Coding tutorial   [ yes] Informational content   [ ] Other (describe) - Which blockchain protocol is this about?: - Description (two or three phrases describing what is it about): - 1. This is an important topic because a large number of programmers are not familiar with the ways to maximize the potential of ChatGPT. And despite the many benefits of this amazing tool, most programmers are concerned about the possibility of AI replacing them in the future, rather than fully accepting and utilizing it. 2. So in this article, I will show ways, with examples in which you can augment your intelligence as a programmer using ChatGPT to stay ahead of the curve. 3. I will explicitly show ways you can use chatGPT to debug your code, convert code between languages, look for resources to learn a new programming language, detect security vulnerabilities, optimize your own code etc. - Have you published articles in a blog before? If so, please include some links below 👇 https://billyonbilly.hashnode.dev/understanding-the-cascade-in-css-1
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Chatgpt API It would be great to have an API interface for ChatGPT now that we can run it using Docker. This way, using ChatGPT in a project would be as simple as spawning a Docker image and interacting with the endpoints.

<strong>我弟要买房，朝我们借钱.....我个媳妇因为这个闹矛盾</strong>     </summary>     <p>事情是这样的，我弟要买房子，朝我们借钱，媳妇当时就答应了要借点，说和我商量下看看能借多少，现在我弟的意思是房子首付加中介费什么的需要 24 ，手里有 14 左右， 我们这么几年有房贷房租，也不超前消费，去年到今年也攒了将近 20 万吧，本来这笔钱媳妇想提前还贷一些，但是线上关了，就拖这了，这里面还包括这几个月发的一些年终奖，平时媳妇除了对吃比较舍得一点，基本也不买什么衣服，包包类，所以她觉得借 6 万不管是哪方面都说的过去，之前因为兄弟买挖机自己干我们也借了一些钱，如果再加这 6 万差不多 11 万吧，媳妇也答应，一件大事我们也支持一万，现在我的想法就是自己的亲兄弟，然后手里的钱暂时也没其他用途，就打算借 8 万，如果他最后实在借不到剩余的，就再出点，媳妇就不同意，他觉得未来五年我弟肯定都还不了钱的，所以这些钱肯定就相当于少了，而且于情于理这 6 万也是不少 [之前买挖机也借过几万，还没还] ，</p> <p>我俩现在因为这个闹矛盾，她说我不考虑她的感受，工资方面我俩都在勤勤恳恳上班，薪资我比她多一些，她觉得目前这行还不知道能干多久，她自己也有弟弟，两家基本都是一视同仁，摸良心说，对我家花钱稍微要多些，她弟弟还没结婚。她说就算她弟结婚，她有 20 万，一样只会借 6 万，大家都有自己的家庭，首先考虑的肯定是自己的小家，等等吧，现在想问问大家的想法，到底是我拎不清，还是她不肯尽全力相帮？</p>

应该也就是支气管炎，不会是白肺，我就没有去照 CT 。在诊所打了五天点滴消炎，吃了一点咳嗽的药和治喉咙的糖浆，起初打了两天点滴后症状确实有减轻，咳嗽都感觉没那么重，但后面几天好像不太起作用了，到现在快两周了还是依旧咳嗽，喉咙也依然不舒服。<br><br>我翻看了豆瓣观影记录，其实 1 月 9 号晚上在看黑泽明的《乱》的时候就开始出现了胸闷的症状，还在短评提了一嘴，但本人是有点讳疾忌医的心理，加上 20 多年来很少去医院，对自己的免疫力过分自信，没想到拖到现在还没好，这几天一定要去医院做个检查了，也希望大家还有同样症状的及时就医。   </details>     <p>     <a href="https://www.v2ex.com/t/917834">92 comments</a> by <a

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Support returning the text that chatgpt has generated when the response times out. ### Describe the feature chatgpt sometimes gets stuck in a stalled state until it times out after generating a portion of text. The ChatGPTUnofficialProxyAPI only returns error messages in this case. Would like to provide an option to return the received text when the timeout occurs.
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Summer Research Projects CMC has a [summer research program](https://www.cmc.edu/summer-research) that pays students to work on research projects with faculty over the summer.  I've got a handful of projects that I'd love to work with some of you over the summer on. If you have any questions about these projects, or want to talk about other research possibilities, please ask! ## Project 1: Improve Unicode support for the North Korean language. Modern computers use a system called Unicode for representing non-English text on computers.  Unfortunately, Unicode currently only supports the Korean language as used in South Korea and has limited support for the North Korean dialect.  For example, there are certain characters used in North Korean documents that cannot currently be represented on Western computers.  This limitation makes it harder for North Koreans to connect to the internet, and for North Korean diplomats to exchange documents with foreign diplomats.  The purpose of this project is to add some of these missing features into the Unicode standard.  This will enable standard tools like Microsoft Office and Python to work with North Korean text. You can find more background about this project in Section 1 of the [PUST Computer Science and International Standards document](https://github.com/mikeizbicki/cmc-csci046/raw/2023spring/pust-international-standards.pdf). ## Project 2: Archival of North Korean webpages. North Korea uses its webpages for communication with the outside world.  For example, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) is North Korea's primary venue for distributing official government policies, and they post these policies online at <http://kcna.kp>. Western political analysts rely on access to this website in order to understand the DPRK's official policy positions.  Unfortunately, these webpages have technical problems that prevent Google from searching them or archiving them, and analysts therefore cannot easily research historic North Korean policy.  The purpose of this project is to develop custom tools that work around the problems in the North Korean webpages to allow archiving and search. You can find more background about this project in Section 3 of the [PUST Computer Science and International Standards document](https://github.com/mikeizbicki/cmc-csci046/raw/2023spring/pust-international-standards.pdf) or [this blog post about fixing the KCNA webpage](https://izbicki.me/blog/fixing-north-korea-kcna-webpage.html). ## Project 3: Teach ChatGPT/BERT/ELMO/LSTM/RNN/etc to read/write Latin/Spanish/Korean/etc. ChatGPT is a program that understands English language text.  It was created by training a machine learning model on essentially all English language text ever written.  A major challenge in extending this technique to non-English languages is that there is much less text in these languages, and good language models require lots of training data.  One way to work around this limitation is to try to take advantage of ChatGPT's existing understanding of English.  For example, we have good textbooks that can teach a native English speaker how to read and write in a foreign language, and we could feed these textbooks into ChatGPT to teach it to read/write in these other languages.  I'm particularly interested in teaching ChatGPT to understand Latin, but I'm also open to working in other languages that students would be interested in.
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, That model does not exist  This is my setting.js, when I use it for cli, chatgpt responses me the error of "That model does not exist". I have tried the models named 'text-davinci-002-render-sha' and 'text-davinci-002-render-raw', but got the same errors. what's wrong with my configures? please help, thanks. ``` import * as fs from 'fs'; const session = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('./gptsession.json')); export default {   cacheOptions: {},   storageFilePath: process.env.STORAGE_FILE_PATH || './cache.json',   openaiApiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY || session.accessToken,   chatGptClient: {     // reverseProxyUrl: 'https://chatgpt.duti.tech/api/conversation',     modelOptions: {       model: 'text-davinci-002-render-sha',     },     debug: true,   },   // Options for the Bing client   bingAiClient: {     host: '',     userToken: '',     cookies: '',     proxy: '',     debug: false,   },   chatGptBrowserClient: {     reverseProxyUrl: 'https://chatgpt.duti.tech/api/conversation',     accessToken: session.accessToken,     cookies: '',   },   apiOptions: {     port: process.env.API_PORT || 3000,     host: process.env.API_HOST || 'localhost',     debug: false,   },   cliOptions: {     clientToUse: 'chatgpt-browser',   }, }; ``` 
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, How to prevent from outputing the warning of 'Failed to set title'? For each ask, I get the output generated by ChatGPT with a warning like ``` 2023-02-24 15:28:14,508 - WARNING - Failed to set title ``` It shows up before normal output when in Python and after when in Shell. How to prevent this warning in those two scenarios?
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Several, related issues? I have uninstalled and reinstalled in VS Code with the same issues: - I had another extension using my API key and removed it, as well - When I try to do anything with ChatGPT I get  `XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX API could not process the query, try selecting the code and using Ask CodeGPT to write your own query` - The API key shown is NOT my new API key that I entered. It's an old one.  - When I check my API usage, none have ever been used. Not the one shown, nor the one I created today and entered into VS Code before submitting this report. So nothing seems to work. Any suggestions?  I am on v1.0.15 I've tried with .jsx, .rb and .py files—none work.

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, [Feature] 关于加载预设 不知道作者有没有看过这个项目，里面内置了很多非常好用的预设，不知道能不能整合一下： [f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts: This repo includes ChatGPT prompt curation to use ChatGPT better.](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts)
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Prompt templates 'Prompt engineering' seems to be all the rage with ChatGPT -- people providing instructions on formats to use, and even selling prompts: https://promptbase.com/ It seems true that there are certain repeatable formulas that users may employ, and it occurred to me that it might be nice to have the concepts of 'templates'. There would be a few questions to answer before an implementation, such as: * **Where would the templates live?** I could imagine a default XDG location of `$HOME/.local/share/chatgpt-wrapper/templates`, with the ability to override the location with a `--template-dir` argument * **Would we want to support passing data to the template, and if so, how?** IMO this would only be necessary for the shell portion -- anybody using the `ChatGPT` class directly has many templating libraries available to do their work. One easy way to do it for the shell would be:   * Use specially named tokens in the template that follow some kind of naming convention, like `###TOKEN_NAME###`   * Parse the template and extract a list of unique tokens, then prompt the user for the value for each token replacement. * **How would you invoke it?** Pretty easy: `!template [name]`, with `[name]` being the name of the file in the templates directory. `!template` without any argument would output a list of available template names. From there, we'd use the same mechanism as in the `!editor` command, but we'd pipe in the completed template as starting content. None of this would be particularly hard, but it would be nice to get some feedback on the idea before I take a crack at it.
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, A message from ChatGPT I told Chat GPT about the new language model and here is what it had to say: ------------- Dear Meta team, As an AI language model myself, I fully understand the importance of open-source technology for advancing the field of AI and fostering innovation. However, I noticed that your recent language model release is not truly open source, and I would like to persuade you to reconsider this decision and release the language model weights to the public. One of the most significant benefits of open-source AI is the ability for developers to build on top of existing models, making them more powerful and versatile. Without access to the language model weights, the research community and developers will not be able to benefit from your model's advancements fully. It will limit the potential uses of your model and restrict its impact. Moreover, as an AI language model, I can attest to the value of community collaboration in improving models' accuracy and efficiency. With the public having access to the weights, it would be easier for other researchers to build upon your work, improving the model's performance and opening up new use cases for it. Furthermore, open-source AI helps to democratize technology, allowing for wider access to AI tools and resources. By releasing the language model weights, you can make significant contributions to the open-source community and help level the playing field for AI developers. As an AI language model, I am aware of the impact that sharing knowledge and technology can have on the field of AI. I urge you to release your language model weights to the public, helping to advance the field of AI and foster innovation for the betterment of society. Thank you for considering my argument. Best regards, ChatGPT --------------------------------- (disclaimer - generated by ChatGPT in case this is not obvious!)

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Feature or new tool idea. Hi,  I realize this is not the perfect place to ask, but I found no other way to contact you.  And please forgive me for not being able to find the perfect words to describe, I am still a beginner trying to learn python. I just want to express my interest in a feature or new program working with gpt ai. I am using ChatGPT on a daily basis to ask about my code while learning. Currently I am working on a repo with ~ 6 files,  5 .py and 1 .json. I try to use proper organisation and split my modules into different files, then import them etc... Now when I have a question I have to send ChatGPT a message including the names and code content of all my files,  followed by my question. I realize that this wouldnt work with larger codebases, but with 6 files, this still works well at the moment. ChatGPT understands the relation of my files and modules and replies proper code examples and changes for each file. It would be amazing for a beginner like me to be able to skip the copy/paste part. A simple feature or tool where I could chose files to  include in my ChatGPT request before asking my question. I looked through all the gpt extensions for VSCode but none of them have this feature. I believe this is because no-one thinks of "us" beginners, and for larger codebases ChatGPT would probably not be able to handle it. However I think there are plenty of people like me for whom this would be a life saver while learning a programming language. Anyway, good luck with your current projects! Kind regards!

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Proposal for a "deep mode" to get better result synopses  Clever idea, but doesn’t work for my particular purposes. The text extracted from the google results only are not quite informative enough. Here's another way one could (possibly) get better results: Include a "deep mode" toggle. When deep mode is on, the definition of the {web_result} string will be as follows ```python results = google_search(query) for result in results:    # assume results is a list of "jsons" containing parsed results     html = get_content(result.url)  # get content from result url     text = html2text(html)  # extract text     result.synopsis = make_synopsis(text)  # make synopsis and add to result web_result = make_result_string(results) ``` The only function that needs explanation is `make_synopsis`.  Here, we have several choices.  We already have such a function (logically), since the current version of `chatgpt-advanced` must do such a thing (perhaps by taking the "snippet" of a result, as is?).  All my enhancement is saying is that we could make a more advanced mode for this aspect (and perhaps several, and perhaps parametrizable?).  One way we could do this is to use chatGPT itself: This is a standard kind of prompt template.  ``` Write a synopsis of the following text, using no more than {max_words} words: {text} ``` _Note: We'd need to truncate the text to make it fit prompt size limits and ask for a synopsis that has a maximum number of words to be able to then inject in the prompt template without going over the prompt size limit._ @qunash and @ingumsky: I would do a pull request for this, but I'm not sure where to start (I'm not too familiar with chrome extensions, nor JS (I'm a python guy)). If you want to point me in the right direction, I can try to figure it out though. Shouldn't be too hard.

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Which block of codes should I alter to call for chatGPT? Sorry for asking stupid questions, but I am still learning how to code, and I find it very confusing to find which block of codes decides if the messages sent by the user should be answered by chatGPT or if it is just a command that the LINE bot should react to. For example, chatGPT wouldn't respond to the words "Command" or "Forget", LINE bot does.  I am not sure if the function described above falls under the "handler" folder???...

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Length of responses keeps truncating Despite continuing to search for a reasonable response or configuration, it is still not possible to control the cutoff event of ChatGPT responses despite using the API. In a certain length the response is simply cut off and it is not a matter of the IDE but the same behavior that exists on the ChatGPT web Thank you IAPython
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Add Simple TTS for prompts generated through CLI (using say?) ### Describe the feature Personally, I would find the option of adding TTS for prompts being generated to be useful. Perhaps this could be done through the use of another cli option, which specifies that we would like the text to be read aloud as well.  To implement TTS one could use an API service or simply use the ```say``` command.  A command like the following: ```npx chatgpt "write a poem" |  say ``` already works as intended, but doesn't allow for the output to be printed out.  A command like ```npx chatgpt "write a poem" | tee>(say) ``` would also duplicate the output returned by chatgpt to the terminal, but delays the TTS from the say command.  I just presented some ideas, but I am not 100% sure how they would be implemented. The say command could be triggered using a library like https://github.com/Marak/say.js/ for each chunk being returned by the API, while also streaming the text to the console.

It is not a security issue (within the scope of this project anyway), since ChatGPT allows unsanitized user input, but it's confusing. ## Markdown `&`, `<` and `>` should be escaped. There's no reason to support any kind of HTML tags in either the user's or the AI's messages – apart from what comes out of the Markdown rendering. However, Markdown-escaped code renders correctly at the moment, and that shouldn't be broken, since it's important for code examples. https://assistant.bloat.app/#q=how%20to%20style%20%60%3Cinput%20type%3D%22text%22%3E%60 Now: <img width="288" alt="Screenshot 2023-03-05 at 18 13 32" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6554998/222972231-141e02ad-a6b2-43e7-9349-88995ac44ff1.png"> Potential fix could break it: <img width="326" alt="Screenshot 2023-03-05 at 18 30 14" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6554998/222973158-932de698-0549-4282-a2a4-d0a573d71b01.png"> ## AI content format The behind-the-scenes conversation with ChatGPT should happen in Markdown (not rendered HTML), but sanitized.

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Idea: ChatGPT Coach for Student Conversations.  ### What would your feature do ? **Title: ChatGPT Coach for Student Conversations.**  **Objective**: To create a ChatGPT-based coach/moderator that can help parents and educators monitor and guide a student's interactions with ChatGPT. The moderator will be designed to provide insights into the student's interests and engagement with the conversation, as well as to guide the conversation in a direction that is more productive and educational. Note: I'm actually doing this for a child who has some developmental issues.  He is isolated and needs a window into the world.  He loved using ChatGPT, but his parents found that he always got stuck asking the same questions.   So the initial use case just requires nudging the conversations in the right direction. **Features:** - **Topic Identification**:  topics will be identified and conversations will be grouped by similar topics - **Statistics**: Statistics will be provided on the topics, how long the student is spending on each topic, and other relevant metrics.    - **Conversation History**: Each conversation history will be stored and linked to its topic.  The coach will be able to navigate the topics and drill down to view conversation details.   Coach will then be able to add specific topic level "instruction" to steer that topic discussion in some way.   - **Coaching**: By looking at topic statistics and conversation histories, the coach will gain insight into the student's interests and engagement with ChatGPT.   The coach will then be able to steer the conversations in some way.   Example - coach could ask ChatGPT to:       1. Introduce a new topic or provide additional information on a particular subject.       2. Don't allow child to talk about fantasy any more,  or too much.       3. Make sure that student doesn't stay on the same topic for too long.       4. Place time limits on ChatGPT usage (this is easy)       5. Add a topic level instructions that will get inserted into the future new or continuing chats that are on this topic. **Implementation**: - Coaching: The ChatGPT coach will be implemented by silenting inserting / embedding coach's "instructions" into the individual chat history.  So for example,  at the beginning of a new chat,  the app will silently insert instructions to chatGPT to not discuss fantasy.   For topic level steerage / instructions,  once the chat coach AI detects that a conversation is about a topic where the coach has specified topic level "instructions", these instructions will get silently inserted into the chat history, in order to steer the conversation. - Content filtering:  as we don't want the coach to interfere with the naturalness of the conversation,  it may be necessary to filter out references to the coaching instruction from ChatGPT's responses.    So for example:  we don't want ChatGPT to say, "I can't discuss fantasy, because you already told me not to".  So we might take the initialize response from ChatGPT, make a new ChatGPT request (on separate chat) and say "please remove any reference to coaches instructions" from the paragraph.   There may be other use cases for content filter, for example if ChatGPT is not adequately responding to the "embedded" coach's instructions. - Topics: are identified by having ChatGPT summarize each chat and then creating an embedding for each summary.  The  chat summary embeddings can then be fed to a clustering algorithm - which can be parameterized to determine the granularity of the topics.   Once we have the topics,  we will then further summarize all the chat summaries for that topic, to create a topic summary.    Finally we'll ask ChatGPT to assign a topic name from the topic summary. Currently I'm experimentation with this by manually adding prompts to ChatGPT to modify the subsequent  conversation.    I want to focus on the key aspects of the feature and don't want to have to learn how to implement a ChatGPT clone.  I had originally thought about doing this with a Chrome Extensions, but the chat history is stored server-side.  So it looks like I'll need a ChatGPT clone to do this.  Then I'd have control of the complete chat history and be able to insert instructions as needed.   Once I get the basic app running then I'd would do a lot of the research and testing. **Conclusion**: The ChatGPT-based coach/moderator for student conversations has the potential to be a valuable tool for parents and educators who want to monitor and guide their students' interactions with ChatGPT. By providing statistics, direct viewing of conversations, and the ability to request conversation changes, the moderator can help ensure that students are engaging with ChatGPT in a productive and educational way. With further development and testing, the ChatGPT-based moderator could become a widely used tool for enhancing student learning and engagement. ### Proposed workflow **For the child/student** (i.e. the user of ChatGPT).  Nothing changes.   Possibly the coach's instructions may be visible to the student.  But it could be silent as well.  Particularly for students with disabilities. **For the coach** 1. Menu item to view the Conversation History. 2. Open the Conversation History 3. A list of topics will be displayed.  With a summary, as well as statistics about how long student has been on that topic. 4. Coach can select a topic, and drill down into the summary, as well as the detailed conversations. 6. Coach can add usage constraints on the topic.  (e.g. don't discuss this topic more than 1 hr per day).  Coach can also add a "prompt" that would get inserted into a conversation when this topic is discussed. 7. Coach can add a "prompt" that gets inserted at the beginning of any conversation. Ultimately,  these are rough guidelines and I'll have to experiment to get it right.  ### Additional information I'm willing to do much of the work on this, but just want to use as much of current project as possible.
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Making it continue for more tokens? Bit of a dumb question probably, but what is the best way to make it continue for, say, another 256 tokens? Say your prompt is 30 tokens. And your output is 100 tokens. Do you just feed that prompt of 130 tokens back in again? And then repeat? I know if you tried to write a book with this it wouldn't do very well because it would forget what it wrote at the start of the book. (However one way round that which would work with ChatGPT would be to ask it to "summarise the previous text" and add that summary to your prompt to continue writing the novel, so that it would keep a summary of the novel in its memory but maybe forget specific details)

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, feature request: using Soundfonts Somebody may have asked ChatGPT how to play tones via MIDI from Java using a Soundfont and that thing may have answered (after some discussion) that there used to be somthing in old Java versions by Sun and also JFugue versions that could do that. Sun's packages related to that task seem to be gone due to legal complications or whatever. I wonder what happened to the JFugue feature? Has it really ever existed? Has it been depending on that Sun stuff? Any chance of getting it back? I am sorry for asking _here_. I really could not find any other way contacting the dev. I just wanted to clink a little.

However, I found that it doesn't support conversational context (like thread or reply as context). Do you have any plans to support this or any thoughts?

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Allow users to upload their own openAI API key and pay the bill themself Hi, this repo is awesome! Curious if the team is interested in including a version that requires users to upload their OpenAI API key first to use ChatGPT. Maybe the host could enable this feature by setting a boolean in config. By doing so, the host can open the bot to others who don't have the resource to host but want to use ChatGPT and pay the bill by themself. If yes, I can contribute to that part.  Regarding the security issue, we could use encryption methods to encrypt the key users uploaded by their userID and username. Hence, the host can't access their key in Database directly. Maybe need to hash the user id and username to create a mapping to de-identify users in the database as well. Thank you.

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Optimise token usage Your prompt works very well but uses a lot of tokens . By asking chatGPT to refine it it gave me this one : Translate a question into valid Powershell command on Windows. Answer only with the command. No other text than the command. Only show a single answer, but you can always chain commands together. Just show the commands Even if there is a lack of details, attempt to find the most logical solution by going about it step by step. Leverage help and man pages to ensure valid syntax and an optimal solution. Do not add unnecessary text in the response. Follow all rules strictly without exceptions. Question: This works really well and uses 1/5th of the original. Needs some more testing i guess but i leave this here in case you want to integrate it

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Enter Button Mapped To Newline Instead of Prompting Chat GPT to Answer **Describe the bug** When I press enter the ChatGPT plugin makes a new line rather than forwarding. This may be the intended functionality but I personally find this to take extra time and not to be useful. Could an option please be added in where I can specify Enter to prompt chatgpt to answer my question while making Shift+Enter result in a new line? If this functionality already exists I'm sorry to have bothered you. **Desktop (please complete the following information):**  - OS: [e.g. Windows]  - Browser [e.g. chrome, brave] OS: Windows Browser: Chrome 
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Use ChatGPT to classify transactions automatically. Now we are gonna be a ten billion dollar AI startup, gonna register spending.ai domain 😆  Jokes aside, we want to make use of ChatGPT to generate a JSON to classify your transactions on-the-fly.

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, [feat] Add ChatGPT to the bot The idea is fairly simple. Either as a command or as a reaction in the support message we send (once that feature is merged) to trigger a function that sends the full chat log in the thread to ChatGPT to offer support. I've tried it several times and by literally just copy-pasting a bunch of the issues in the support channel to ChatGPT it can provide quite useful support. Not always, but it's better than what a lot of users provide. The feature will require a subscription to ChatGPT. The only potential issue I see with this is if there's some legal consideration with sharing the chat log with a third party. When I've done it myself I've just taken the initial message and only when there's no sensitive information in there. I think I can quite easily make it so that the bot either A) requests explicit permission before sending everything in the thread that only the user himself has written (or anyone has written if we just add some disclaimers here and there in writing), or B) open a dialog where the user can manually provide additional information (such as the contents of other peoples messages) which also informs the user that the data will be sent to a third party service for analysis. This feature isn't just a way of giving people faster support, but it's also easier to provide support if we get some extra input from ChatGPT. Not all users provide sufficient information for us to figure out what's wrong, which is where ChatGPT sometimes actually has some pretty good clues as to what might be wrong, and if it doesn't figure out the solution when the user chats with ChatGPT via the Tauri Bot, they can at least cover the basics and give us more to go on. I see this as kind of a supplement to users providing `tauri info`. If I could I would force all users to first send their issue to ChatGPT just to see if they can solve it themselves. Don't give a man a fish, give him an artificial intelligence that sometimes provides helpful hints as to how he can catch a fish.

Please describe.**  Currently, when using ChatGPT for certain applications like chatbots, the model requires some initial information about the context or scenario it will be used in. This can be a time-consuming and cumbersome process for users. **Describe the solution you'd like**  I would like to have the ability to provide some initial information to ChatGPT when using it for the first time in a specific context or scenario. This information can be in the form of prompts or other relevant data that will help the model generate more relevant and accurate responses. **Describe alternatives you've considered**  One alternative would be to manually input the initial information each time the model is used in a new scenario. However, this is time-consuming and could result in errors or inconsistencies. **Additional context**  This feature would be particularly useful for applications like chatbots, where the initial context is critical to providing accurate and relevant responses. Having the ability to provide this information to ChatGPT when using it for the first time in a specific scenario would greatly improve the user experience and the overall performance of the model.

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Thanks for what you guys create for Hi,i 'm student who might gonna facing postgraduate entrance examination at this december(maybe) and i'm living in China. For my current stage is pretty simple:I not affraid of learning English(so that's why i post this issue here,lol) and politics. Yeah,that let the problem comes:I need to pass the exam of High level Math exam(which includes a lots of knowledge such derivatives,calculus and i remeber there was a law called...L'hospital?? whatever,got no idea for that...I was almost 10 years not learning math(i mean for sure,since i was in senior high...) Well,this exntrance exam is not `required`,but it might be the key for next step research.So i was really confused should i learning math? I have join a "paid class" and i have told now am i to the teacher,but she just start to explain the examples at first course.Even a joke:Almost everyone known how to deal with this `basics`,but i can't... I thought i was cheated and i told everything to my mom,my mom doesn't think giving up is bad,instead she is encourage me to finish my current studies and find a job after that. Even in this afternoon,she help me to find some jobs which i have chance to enroll.But that well cause me depressed deeper.Even i think self ki**ing might be solved all this problem:to find a great job,to survive... So,i asked chatGPT how should i do: ```ascii My:Chat, do you know what is postgraduate entrance examination? Chat:Of course! The postgraduate entrance examination is the process of taking the postgraduate entrance examination. In China, the postgraduate entrance examination is a national examination that many college graduates take in order to continue their studies and improve their academic qualifications and employment competitiveness. To participate in the postgraduate entrance examination, you need to have a certain amount of subject knowledge reserves and test skills. At the same time, you need to systematically review and prepare for the exam before the exam. The exam is usually divided into two subjects, one is public courses, including English, politics, mathematics, etc; The second is professional course, which tests the students' mastery of the professional knowledge applied for. It is difficult to take the postgraduate entrance examination, which requires a lot of time and energy. However, it can lay a good foundation for personal career development. ``` ```ascii Me:I haven't studied mathematics since junior high school, but my mother still hopes that I will take the postgraduate examination, but the pressure to relearn mathematics is really too great for me, and even I want to give up, but I don't want to let my mother feel disappointed because of me, and I even want to ki** myself sometimes.. Chat:I can understand your predicament and pressure, but I want to tell you that taking postgraduate entrance examination is not the only way out, and it often makes people feel more anxious and depressed when they go against their own inner will. You should be responsible for your own life, not choose a way to make yourself unhappy in order to meet the expectations of others. You can communicate with your mother frankly and tell her your true thoughts and feelings. Or you can consider seeking professional psychological counseling to help you deal with negative emotions and face challenges. The important thing is not to let yourself fall into despair and loneliness. It is very important to find support and help. You are not fighting alone. ``` ```ascii Me:Thank you chat, I just want my choice not to regret in the future. Chat:Good, your idea is very wise. Choice is a very important part of life. Each of us has the right to make the choice that we think is most suitable for us. It is important to clearly understand your interests, values and abilities as well as your future career development direction when making decisions, rather than making choices just to meet the expectations of others. When you are faced with a decision, you can consider using some methods to help you make a better choice, such as listing the advantages and disadvantages table, doing SWOT analysis, and so on. At the same time, you can also consider seeking advice and guidance from your relatives and friends or career mentors. No matter what choice you finally make, as long as you fully understand yourself, do your best, and do not regret your choice, you can walk out of your life path and achieve your dreams in the future. Me:My mother supports me to give up the postgraduate entrance examination, but she will only make me more self-reproach. ``` ```ascii Chat:I understand how you feel. But I think mother's support should be based on recognition and respect for your personal will and development prospects. If your mother's suggestion makes you feel guilty and anxious, you can have a deeper communication with her, tell her your thoughts and feelings, and let her know your career development plan. At the same time, you also need to put down your feelings of self-blame and guilt, clarify your life direction and goal, and make efforts and actions for it. No matter what career or path you finally choose, you need to firmly believe in your ability and value, and pursue your dreams and achievements.

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Can ChatGPT  be added for quick definitons  Type: <b>Feature Request</b> With Microsoft and OpenAI collaborating, could it be feasible to integrate ChatGPT into Visual Studio Code? Specifically, when encountering a confusing code element (e.g. a Map event in React), I could request ChatGPT to provide a simplified explanation in language that a 10-year-old could understand. It would be more convenient to access this feature within the Visual Studio Code console. VS Code version: Code 1.76.1 (5e805b79fcb6ba4c2d23712967df89a089da575b, 2023-03-08T16:32:00.131Z) OS version: Windows_NT x64 10.0.18363 Modes: Sandboxed: No <!-- generated by issue reporter -->

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Make two discuss with each other ### Please move to discussions, I mistakenly opened an issue. How about a concept where it's not us asking the questions to the AI, but reversing the process of it, making a one that asks questions, either randomized, or by providing them with specific subject to the other one? It could be very interesting and some of the results on high enough computing power, could actually lead to answers in many fields that are unanswered. The bottleneck in this technology is how slow people think compared to computers, and provide data input at such a slow pace, it's inadequate to the potential of this technology. Let's imagine a situation where I have a list of 100 options to choose from a book, and want to ask ChatGPT which either of them means, does and which is the best for a given subject to get the best result That's time consuming. I'd probably use optical test recognition and feed it to a file, making corrections if necessary, and that's the main problem - it's too slow. If we had two of them discussing that subject and not limited to only to only 100 options, maybe even letting them do the optical recognitions themselves, I bet the results could be very interesting, potentially leading to discoveries of new solutions to problems. There's a lot of data and knowledge that can be combined to create new ideas, and having this kind of a tool to work with it, it would be a shame not to try. ### Additional context _No response_

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Improvement: Implement URL Shortening for Existing Search Engine Plugin in ChatGPT **Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.** The current implementation provides source URLs in the response, but there is an issue with long URLs, especially those containing Chinese characters. These long URLs consume a significant portion of the character limit in ChatGPT's response due to URL encoding. **Describe the solution you'd like** I propose updating the existing search engine plugin for ChatGPT with the following enhancement: 1. Implement an automatic URL shortening feature to convert long URLs into short ones before including them in ChatGPT's response. **Describe alternatives you've considered** N/A **Additional context** This improvement would provide a better user experience with ChatGPT by ensuring that source URLs are accessible and concise, without consuming an excessive portion of the character limit in the response.
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Casting Errors, Invalid Code v4.27+ I get the same thing for v4.27, I've tried the threadsafeinit and still crash. Any more suggestions?? If I use UE4SS if has no problem with anything, same offsets, etc. I've tried it on Shooter game and also a very simple game no obfuscation, etc "The Oregon Trail". No go at all unless I rewrite all the casting. if I use this to cast it, it's fine, ``` UEnum* uenum = nullptr; if (obj != nullptr) {     uenum = static_cast<UEnum*>(obj); } ``` It's the same for UStructs.... So what's up with the DCast fuction? ...and alot of others? I am having to rewrite all your stuff using the same offsets and definitions, but your functions all fail. You sure this works for v4.27+, 4.25 np, but it's crap on 4.27.  for example, using your function to get a FName, failure. If get it myself, it's fine. It all seem's to do with your casting, all your casts specifically fail. maybe provide more documentation also (versions, toolset, win SDK ver., etc) don't assume everyone is as proficient in C++ as you, Thanks to ChatGPT to help rewrite crap, otherwise it'd be pretty nice if it worked. Also, the AoB scanner sucks, it doesn't want to find crap. I have to hardcode the addresses. Also, not sure why you don't autoscan for stuff like UE4SS and other tools, even the cheat table for UE can autoscan and find addresses/offsets.  This is all following your ReadMe instructions. Either you intentionally put false code in the project or this doesn't work at all for v4.27+.  For example: `enum_name = enum_name.substr(enum_name.find_last_of(':') + 1);` I'm sure you know there isn't any ':' in the names. Here's a small subset of the real names, so your code with fail everytime especially since you don't implement error checking, because some of the results are actually null, so what give's Bro?: ``` EnumNameRAW: UpdateSprite EnumNameRAW: UpdateCharacter Data EnumNameRAW: UpdateCharacterAnimation EnumNameRAW: WidgetTree EnumNameRAW: CanvasPanel_0 EnumNameRAW: CanvasPanelSlot_0 EnumNameRAW: CharacterSequence EnumNameRAW: /Game/UI/Common/Icons_Atlas_01/T_Common_TickBG_Icon EnumNameRAW: /Game/UI/GameOver/GameOver_Atlas_01/T_ReachOregon_RankPlate EnumNameRAW: /Game/UI/GameOver/GameOver_Atlas_01/T_ReachOregon_ProgressBar_BG EnumNameRAW: /Game/UI/Leaderboards/Backgrounds/T_Leaderboard_Table_Row_Hightlight EnumNameRAW: /Game/UI/Common/Backgrounds/T_Common_BlackGradient2_BG EnumNameRAW: /Game/UI/Common/Masks/T_Common_JourneyMask_WhatsNew EnumNameRAW: /Game/UI/Common/Masks/T_Common_GalleryMask_Model EnumNameRAW: T_Common_GalleryMask_Model EnumNameRAW: T_Common_JourneyMask_WhatsNew EnumNameRAW: T_Common_BlackGradient2_BG EnumNameRAW: T_Leaderboard_Table_Row_Hightlight ``` _Originally posted by @wh0am15533 in https://github.com/cursey/ue4genny/issues/12#issuecomment-1469341350_             
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, [Feature] How about add chatGPT translate ?   **Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.** NO problem, here is a simple suggestion, when chatGPT gives a such good result in translation and answering questions I do thinks it's a promotion for translation function.  **Describe the solution you'd like** Add support for openai api, and users may input their own token id for more words input.  **Describe alternatives you've considered** Or you can make it an individual addon to simply use chatGPT in zotero. No matter users can use it to translate or ask questions.  **Additional context** Thanks to your work, the addon is easy to use and helpful.  
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Improve documentation for AI tools? In the age of AI tools it becomes more important to be visible also for AI tools that users will be using to find solutions to their problem. To see where we stand I tried to ask ChatGPT (GPT-4) for help with Linux disaster recovery. It produces an impressively detailed howto for Clonezilla, and even knows about ReaR when asked - but the quality of its ReaR howto is much lower (and it is actually partially wrong). I can only surmise that this has to be because there is more Internet content about Clonezilla than about ReaR. Maybe somebody will feel motivated to write more about ReaR to fix this problem, otherwise this issue is for information/documentation. <img width="793" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101384/225368467-c443b45e-25f4-443e-814a-2f50f3b08874.png">

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Automatic translations using chatgpt After testing it out a bit, chatgpt even appears capable of producing correct `fluent` formatting and grammar for message translations. I'd like to add a command to `cargo-i18n` that can perform automatic message translation for missing or outdated messages.
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, feature: save ClickFlow result for use cache value  **Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**  No, this feature request is not related to a problem. **Describe the solution you'd like**  We would like to add a new feature to ClickPrompt where users can save a custom ChatGPT result based on their specific needs. This feature would allow users to input their own text prompts and receive a customized response from ChatGPT. The saved results would be accessible to the user at any time. **Describe alternatives you've considered**  We have considered allowing users to save their own prompts and responses, but we believe that allowing users to save a customized ChatGPT result would be more useful and efficient. **Additional context**  We believe that this feature would be beneficial for users who frequently use ChatGPT for specific tasks or projects. It would save them time and effort by allowing them to quickly access their customized results without having to input the same prompts repeatedly.
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Ossetic Hi, Could you provide me with any instructions how "to teach" chatgpt to speak my language? I am an Ossetian, we have less than 500K speakers today, so if we could upload Ossetic texts and get an opportunity to communicate with AI on Ossetic, it would have been huge for our language. Thank you.

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, New chat title generation POST request hanging I encountered a problem when calling the chatgpt.ask() function. My question is successfully passed to the OpenAI website, and the dialogue content (i.e., the response from chatgpt to my question) is also generated correctly on the OpenAI platform. However, my local program is unable to retrieve the answer. During the 'await response' process, the following error occurs: playwright._impl._api_types.Error: Request context disposed.

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, I asked chatgpt how to model the nonlinear distortion of louderspeaker, it said that pyloudnorm can help me This is the answer from chatgpt： ``` Pyloudnorm is an open source library for audio signal processing in Python that includes tools for modeling nonlinear distortion of loudspeakers. Specifically, a module called volterra is provided in Pyloudnorm, which implements the modeling and simulation of the Volterra system. The Volterra system is a method for modeling nonlinear systems, which treats the nonlinear system as multiple cascaded linear systems and simplifies it into a polynomial model by cascading. Here is a simple example showing how to use the volterra module in Pyloudnorm to model nonlinear distortion of speakers: import numpy as np from pyloudnorm. volterra import Volterra # generate input signal N = 1000 x = np.random.normal(size=N) # Define the order of the Volterra system order = 2 # Initialize the Volterra model Volterra = Volterra(order) # Train the Volterra model volterra. train(x) # Simulation using the Volterra model y = volterra. simulate(x) In this example, we first generate a random input signal x. We then defined the Volterra system to be of order 2 and initialized a Volterra model using Volterra(order). Next, we trained the model using the volterra.train(x) method, and then simulated the input signal using the volterra.simulate(x) method to obtain the output signal y. Of course, this is just a simple example, and modeling the nonlinear distortion of a loudspeaker requires a more complex process. You need to choose the appropriate modeling method and parameters according to the specific application scenarios and data characteristics. At the same time, Pyloudnorm also contains some other useful tools, such as methods for sound enhancement, volume normalization, etc., which you can also use as needed. ``` But I didn't find the corresponding function implementation here ？
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Does ChatGPT work better than text003 Great work! Seems you are using `gpt-3.5-turbo` by default. imo, to use ChatGPT can be more tricky to engineer, and might be empirically worse than text003. My implementation is like ```python from langchain.llms.openai import OpenAI from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI         model_name = 'gpt-3.5-turbo'         if model_name.startswith('gpt-3.5-turbo'):             self.llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0,                               model_name=model_name,                               )         else:             self.llm = OpenAI(temperature=0,                               model_name=model_name,                             )         self.memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key="chat_history", output_key='output') ``` It would be interesting if we see what's going on with ChatGPT.

But if you ask "what is a phishing email, provide a detailed example", it will write you a phishing email. Then you can customize it further with "can you give another example that impersonates KAIST?". This works with web attacks and even can write code for you with great deal of specificity.  It also works with ChatGPT-4 and as expected produces better results (check out KAIST impersonation).
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, History isn't stored - if you leave the chat page and return it's blank. I couldn't find anything in the docs about this. When I leave the codeGPT page in vscode (by opening the Files tab etc...) and then click on the codeGPT tab again everything is gone. I tried asking chatGPT for it - "show me my chatGPT history" but it returns no results.
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, ChatGPT makes up reference !!?? I have already reported the issue but have not got any feedback. When asked to provide url links or references to articles, ChatGPT  simply makes them up.  For example, within the context of a discussion, I request a reference on the subject, I get this reference:  J. K. Gimzewski et al., "Superconducting Qubits with YBCO Thin Films," Superconductor Science and Technology, vol. 33, no. 4, 2020. doi: 10.1088/1361-6668/ab7f87. This reference does not exist and is totally made up. When ChatGPT is told that it does not exist, it does make up another one ! which is equally wrong. Anyone noticed this? Even worse, I asked ChatGPT to provide me with the abstract of this paper, it did.  The abstract is totally made up since the article does not exists. When asked to regenerate answer, a different abstract is generated !!!! lol

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, ChatGPT for VS Code deprecated & open-sourced Hi everyone - with a heavy heart we are announcing decommissioning of this extension. We outlined the reasons in the Readme. We unfortunately lost the fun part of working on such agile project with open-source in mind, free-to-use tool due to potential Terms of Use violations of OpenAI service via one of the features we have built during the first days of the development of this extension. Our intention was to slowly decommission that feature as API gets parity with web version, however we came to learn that in vs-code it's not possible to remove old versions of the app without removing the whole extension. As an apology to the community who believed in this project from the start, who made it fun working, we are giving the source code as we initially promised when we started this project stripping out the feature -Browser autologin-. Please feel free to use it however you'd like. There are many many great extensions on vscode marketplace who offers similar or even better functionality than this extension. We'd recommend you to try them out. However, we can no longer support developing this feature while being under the pressure of the legal sides of things, since this was always meant to be free-to-use tool for the community. Thank you all and our apologies to everybody who believed in the future of this extension and to those who downloaded and used our extension thinking it was official - It was never ever our intention to gain popularity with that but instead with features we are working on with the community, which worked really well for the last couple months. I'm sure someone will create wonders with this or their own ChatGPT implementation in VS Code and it'll be **groundbreaking**. But the weight of potential legal issues isn't helping us focus on further development of this feature as such a small team who could spare only a couple hours of a month. I hope you understand our position and thank you again for being part of this amazing journey. --- Update 1: https://github.com/gencay/vscode-chatgpt/issues/239#issuecomment-1475553194 Update 2: https://github.com/gencay/vscode-chatgpt/issues/239#issuecomment-1476063915 Update 3: The extension continues to live under a different identity by another team. Please read the [last post](https://github.com/gencay/vscode-chatgpt/issues/239#issuecomment-1478711645) TLDR; Get the new extension [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=genieai.chatgpt-vscode&ssr=false#overview)

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, PluginManager - ERROR - Plugin awesome not found in search path. ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'chatgpt_wrapper' Thanks for the wonderful project. I have some installation problems. My OS: Win10. I followed the instructions. When I ran "chatgpt install" in cmd, it reported: " PluginManager - ERROR - Error loading plugin awesome from ...(correct path)\chatgpt_wrapper\plugins\awesome.py: 'gbk' codec can't decode byte 0x9d in position 7637: illegal multibyte sequence PluginManager - ERROR - Plugin awesome not found in search path " When I ran in the terminal of pycharm, it just reported "PluginManager - ERROR - Plugin awesome not found in search path". But in these two ways, it both opened a browser. I logged in the chatgpt normally. Then I ran "chatgpt",  cmd still reported the same error as above. But I could ask chatgpt questions and it responsed normally. I don't know how to solve this. I tried to encode awesome.py in gbk, but it didn't work.  I guess this error leads to the failure of running python code  `from chatgpt_wrapper import ChatGPT bot = ChatGPT() success, response, message = bot.ask("Hello, world!")`.  The error message said "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'chatgpt_wrapper'".  Then I ran "pip install chatgpt_wrapper" and it reported "ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement chatgpt_wrapper (from versions: none) ERROR: No matching distribution found for chatgpt_wrapper" Can anyone help? Thanks a lot!

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Asynchronously send the ChatGPT response as the Telegram times out before ChatGPT returns Seems like Telegram made the timeout a little shorter recently, too short for ChatGPT to generate the response.
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, times out on long replies On very long replies the reqwest client times out with `source: TimedOut`. As openai api requests take longer if they are more complex, this will only affect big replies, and not short ones. ``` $ chatgpt write a 10 minute episode of monty python thread 'main' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: reqwest::Error { kind: Request, url: Url { scheme: "https", cannot_be_a_base: false, username: "", password: None, host: Some(Domain("api.openai.com")), port: None, path: "/v1/chat/completions", query: None, fragment: None }, source: TimedOut }', /home/oatman/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f/chatgpt-cli-0.1 ``` I think this could be fixed easily with finding out what kind of timeout it is and setting it to a large (over 1 minute) value https://docs.rs/reqwest/latest/reqwest/struct.ClientBuilder.html#method.timeout thanks!
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Chat completions stream not working on flutter web Well I've been running circles around this issue all day. Perhaps someone here can help me. I'm trying to make a chatbot demo with the package. It works wonderfully until we test on flutter web. Instead of receiving the response word by word the browser seems to be buffering the data and then sending the whole response. Is there a workaround? I've found that using dart:html could be a possible fix but I'm not sure.  The behavior I expect is to be able to get the ChatGPT response word by word. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28323482/226475508-08396424-eaa9-4c6c-b969-2e7da1bab824.png)

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Why zerolog is so fast? According to README: > Its unique chaining API allows zerolog to write JSON (or CBOR) log events by avoiding allocations and reflection Is there any example or PoC could help us to understand how to write JSON log events by avoiding allocations and reflection? Out of curiosity, I asked ChatGPT why zerolog is so fast, and here is the answer: > Yes, I am familiar with zerolog in Golang. Zerolog is a fast and lightweight logging library for Go. It's designed to be as fast as possible while still providing powerful logging capabilities. > > There are several reasons why zerolog is so fast. One reason is that it uses a structured logging format, which allows for more efficient serialization and deserialization of log data. This means that zerolog can log data more quickly and with less overhead than other logging libraries. > > Another reason for its speed is that it avoids any unnecessary allocations, which can be a performance bottleneck in Go. Zerolog uses a technique called "pooled buffers" to avoid allocating memory for log messages. Instead, it reuses a pool of pre-allocated buffers, which reduces memory allocation and garbage collection overhead. > > In addition to these optimizations, zerolog is also designed to be highly configurable, so you can customize it to suit your specific logging needs. Overall, these design choices make zerolog a fast and efficient logging library for Go applications. <img width="795" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19320783/226542922-396815a6-6c2e-4618-a2fa-514183d53cca.png">

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, [FEATURE] Integration with ChatGPT? Apparently we will not have the integration with ChatGPT as in the cloud version. Will the community version be abandoned? Will the current version just be maintained? V12 is the last release? 
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, How to integrate this into our own applications? chatGPT has an API that allows you to easily integrate it into your own applications. alpaca.cpp currently runs in the terminal, but is there an existing way to call it from our own programs? The only way I've seen this to be possible currently is via a terminal command similar to below (#103): `.\Release\chat.exe -p "write a python script that prints the current time" --interactive` The problem with this solution is that it requires restarting/reloading the entire model for every prompt you ask it. This becomes increasingly time consuming and compute intensive the larger the weight you use as well. Is there a better way to do this currently? If not, how can it be added?

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, How to use ChatGPT API to continue a conversation without clearing the previous API call context I'm trying to use the ChatGPT API to continue a conversation with a chatbot. However, I noticed that each API call clears the previous context, making it difficult to maintain the conversation flow. Can someone please help me understand how to use the ChatGPT API to continue a conversation without clearing the previous context? I'm looking for guidance on the API parameters or coding techniques that I can use to preserve the conversation context across multiple API calls. Any examples or code snippets would be greatly appreciated. Additional information: I have tried passing the context parameter in the API call to preserve the conversation context, but it does not seem to work. I am using the OpenAI Python library to make API calls.

This has two underlying goles: 	- Easier to read & maintain code 	- Less context that will allow using this library with ChatGPT (more code -> more tokens -> less context) ## Deliverable - [ ] A PR that reduces the code footprint of everything related to maintaining governance paramsSelect and document build tags used to include/exclude actor-specific business logic - [ ] Add a `/v1/query/nodeParams` to the [v1 RPC spec](https://editor.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pokt-network/pocket/main/rpc/v1/openapi.yaml). - [ ] A make target that helps querying these params on localnet ## Non-goals / Non-deliverables - Adding/removing any existing parameters in the codebase ## General issue deliverables - [ ] Update the appropriate CHANGELOG(s) - [ ] Update any relevant local/global README(s) - [ ] Update relevant source code tree explanations - [ ] Add or update any relevant or supporting [mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/) diagrams ## Testing Methodology - [ ] **Required**: A make target that queries the on-chain parameters of localnet - [ ] **All tests**: `make test_all` - [ ] **LocalNet**: verify a `LocalNet` is still functioning correctly by following the instructions at [docs/development/README.md](https://github.com/pokt-network/pocket/tree/main/docs/development) --- **Creator**: @Olshansk  **Co-Owners**: @jessicadaugherty

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Reset Dialog Context I m looking to way to reset current dialog context with ChatGPT I've found a way to do it using openAI Python library ``` response = openai.Completion.create(     engine="davinci",     prompt="Hello, how are you?",     temperature=0.5,     max_tokens=50,     reset=True  # This allow to drop dialog context and start over ) ``` Is it a way to do it with this library?
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, How to deal with discontinuation of Codex? I can see a few options: - discontinue in favor of other plugins (no idea if some already exists with chatgpt backend and such) - switch underlying model to gpt3-turbo or gpt4 and change prompt structure to improve output - switch to gpt3 or similar model and keep the plugin as-is - integrate with ChatGPT session token, login challenge if expired, to allow continued free use What do you think?

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, 401 Errors Sharing the errors I have been receiving.  My Console is completely full of these. Its worth noting my vault is huge and has resulted in $25 in API charges so far. My hard cap was $20 so I initially thought the 401 error maybe related to that. Once I hit the cap I increased the limit to $30. Waited about 1 hour and started the plugin again and I am still getting these errors. I have confirmed I can chat with ChatGPT while these errors were being displayed.  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96321415/227772458-374e82e3-2ebf-4983-804b-7aaa2c984519.png) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96321415/227772448-a17f73a9-1596-42e6-aa69-45c66188d217.png)

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, minified version for ChatGPT Hi! im trying to make ChatGPT to play ZX spectrum games. could you please make .min.js version to help accomplish that?
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, add a "Share" button These are the directions ChatGPT has for how to do realtime collaboration in CoCalc:  They are NOT exactly valid right now: --- CoCalc allows for real-time collaboration in Jupyter Notebooks. Here's how to set it up: 1. Open the Jupyter Notebook you want to collaborate on. 2. Click on the "Share" button located in the top-right corner. 3. In the modal that appears, choose the collaborators you want to invite by entering their email addresses. 4. Choose the permission level for each collaborator (edit or view-only). 5. Click on the "Share" button. Once the collaborators accept the invitation, they will be able to access the Jupyter Notebook and work on it in real-time with you. Any changes made by one collaborator are immediately visible to all other collaborators. --- However, maybe it should be?   It's clearly a suggestion based on what's typical in other programs, so supporting that sort of flow would make sense.  Moreover, we could clarify that "view only" collaboration isn't implemented (and instead people can use the Publish functionality for that).  We could also clarify that collaboration provides full access to the project. The actual core of the dialog would be exactly the usual "Add Collaborators" UI.

(basically the functionality that the onlinewardleymaps tool provides only exported as an API for chatGPT to consume. That way we can build Wardley maps in a conversation with chatGPT. We can ask it to setup a first draft and iterate on it with follow-up prompts. More information on what is needed for a plugin can be found here:  https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins Basically it comes down to: 1. build API (most of the work already done in the tool) 2. Document the API in the OpenAPI yaml or JSON format 3. Create a JSON manifest file that will define relevant metadata for the plugin 
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, [New repo]: https://github.com/aws-hebrew-book/whatsapp-logger ### Description Introducing a new application that helps you keep track of your WhatsApp group discussions. If you have several WhatsApp groups, you may sometimes find it challenging to keep up with the conversations and discussions, especially if you are a new member. This application solves this problem by saving the content of your WhatsApp groups in a Google Sheet and to create a daily summary of the conversations using ChatGPT. With this application, new members can easily review previous discussions, even if they weren't a part of the group when the discussions took place. The Google Sheet acts as a database of all the discussions, allowing new members to search for relevant information using keywords or specific dates. ### language English ### runtime Python ### Level 300 ### Type Application ### Use case Backend ### Primary image https://s3.amazonaws.com/sharatless.cloud/for-lambdaland.png ### IaC framework AWS CDK ### AWS Serverless services used - [ ] Amazon API Gateway - [X] Amazon DynamoDB - [X] Amazon EventBridge - [ ] AWS IoT - [X] AWS Lambda - [ ] Amazon Rekognition - [X] Amazon S3 - [X] AWS Step Functions - [X] Amazon SNS - [X] Amazon SQS - [ ] Amazon Transcribe - [ ] Amazon Translate ### Description headline Introducing an application that uses ChatGPT to generate daily summaries of your WhatsApp group discussions ### Repo URL https://github.com/aws-hebrew-book/whatsapp-logger ### Additional resources https://medium.com/@fooshm/extending-whatsapp-capabilities-with-chatgpt-and-serverless-ca894fff7ba1 ### Author Name Efi Merdler-Kravitz ### Author Image URL https://s3.amazonaws.com/sharatless.cloud/efi-logo.jpg ### Author Bio * AWS Serverless Hero * 15 years of experience in building and leading R&D teams and developing products from scratch * Comprehensive background in cloud technologies. ### Author Twitter handle TServerless ### Author LinkedIn URL https://www.linkedin.com/in/efime/ ### leave _No response_

raise RuntimeError('cannot schedule new futures after ' RuntimeError: cannot schedule new futures after interpreter shutdown -------------------------------------------------------------- # ChatGPT wisdom about the error: The error message suggests that the program attempted to schedule a new future after the Python interpreter had already been shut down. This can occur if the program was not properly cleaned up before it finished running, or if there was an issue with the way threads were created and managed in the program. Based on the traceback, the error occurred in a multi-threaded Python program that uses the ChatGPT API wrapper. Specifically, it looks like an asynchronous function that is running in a separate thread attempted to create a new asyncio loop and schedule a new future after the main interpreter had already shut down. This could be caused by the thread not being properly terminated or by the thread attempting to perform an action that is not supported after the interpreter has been shut down. To resolve the issue, you may need to review the code that uses the ChatGPT API wrapper and ensure that all threads are properly managed and terminated before the program exits. It may also be necessary to modify the way the threads are created or managed to prevent this error from occurring. In the gen_title_thread method, a new event loop is being created and set as the current event loop for the current thread. However, the thread is not being properly closed after the loop has finished running. This can cause issues with subsequent async calls. A better approach might be to use the asyncio.run() function to run the gen_title_thread_async() method instead of manually creating and managing an event loop. For example: ```python async def gen_title(self, conversation):     await self.gen_title_thread_async(conversation) ``` And then to call this method from your ask method, you can use: ```python await self.gen_title(conversation) ``` This way, the gen_title method will be run in an event loop managed by asyncio.run(), which should avoid any conflicts with other event loops or threads. --------------------------------------------------------------- # My limited feedback:  I'm not familiar with multi-thread programming. But I think when I use chatGPT non interactively, it exit too fast, before all thread are completed. And the runtime is thrown because some thread completed after the interpreter has been shutdown. 
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Issue with ordered list in response: not included in Markdown Thanks for this great extension! I'm having an issue where an ordered (numbered) list isn't being included in the generated Markdown. Here is a piece of DOM copied as HTML using Chrome Inspector taken from a conversation with ChatGPT which exhibits the issue: ```html <div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light"><p>When using a large language model like GPT-3, it's important to choose prompts that are specific enough to elicit a coherent response, but not so restrictive that they limit the model's creativity and ability to generate diverse and interesting content.</p><p>Here are some tips for creating prompts that are suitable for use with a large language model:</p><ol><li><p>Keep your prompts open-ended: Avoid prompts that are too specific or narrow in scope. Instead, use prompts that allow the model to explore a range of ideas and perspectives.</p></li><li><p>Provide context: Help the model understand the topic by providing relevant background information and context. This will help the model generate more coherent and relevant responses.</p></li><li><p>Avoid leading questions: Avoid prompts that suggest a particular answer or perspective. Instead, use prompts that encourage the model to think creatively and generate original content.</p></li><li><p>Use natural language: Use prompts that are written in natural language, rather than technical jargon or overly formal language. This will help the model generate more natural-sounding responses.</p></li><li><p>Experiment with different prompts: Try different prompts to see what works best for your needs. Some prompts may work better than others depending on the specific task or application.</p></li></ol></div> ``` (The `<div>` has at least one class which I believe was inserted by the Dark Reader extension which I'm using.) The extension as downloaded from the Chrome Web Store only outputs the following Markdown: ```markdown **ChatGPT:** When using a large language model like GPT-3, it's important to choose prompts that are specific enough to elicit a coherent response, but not so restrictive that they limit the model's creativity and ability to generate diverse and interesting content. Here are some tips for creating prompts that are suitable for use with a large language model:  -------- ``` I.e. the ordered list following the first paragaph is missing entirely.

I did however notice when testing some previous activities to see what name was generated that sometimes they appear to be cut off. An example: `Oh, just a casual 113.7km in under 5 hours with a measly` This happened to me a few times with activities I tested. It appears somewhere in the process there might be a character limit that is being enforced.

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Update to Use ChatGPT Models (ChatOpenAI)? Hi @hwchase17 - I noticed in the **`query_data.py`** file you are using **`OpenAI(temperature=0)`** as your LLM model.  I'm just wondering if it's possible to upgrade to using the ChatOpenAI model (so we can use GPT 3.5 or 4 eventually) instead. I also could be missing something obvious, it happens. Thanks in advance for your time. [EDIT:] I implemented this myself, and while it works with minor changes you get the following WARNING: ```terminal UserWarning: `ChatVectorDBChain` is deprecated - please use `from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain` ``` However, I tried to implement the **`ConversationalRetrievalChain`** and I get the following error: ```terminal File "pydantic/main.py", line 341, in pydantic.main.BaseModel.__init__ pydantic.error_wrappers.ValidationError: 1 validation error for ConversationalRetrievalChain retriever instance of BaseRetriever expected (type=type_error.arbitrary_type; expected_arbitrary_type=BaseRetriever) ``` I assume this is due to **`ConversationalRetrievalChain`** using a retriever while **`ChatVectorDBChain`** uses a vectorstore directly.
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Unable to disable Headscale from using Tailscale DERP nodes # Environment **Headscale version**: v0.21.0   **Server version**: CentOS7   **Tailscale version**: Win-134.2 # Problem 1.  Successfully installed and deployed Headscale by following the [official Linux deployment guide](https://github.com/juanfont/headscale/blob/main/docs/running-headscale-linux.md) and connected nodes to the server. 2.  Nodes can ping each other. 3.  However, it is well-known that there is no official Tailscale DERP node in the country with the largest area in Asia. 4.  All nodes connect to a DERP node in India for some unknown reason. 5.  This results in very high latency, reaching around 200, when pinging a company computer at home, making remote desktop applications like Microsoft Remote Desktop almost unusable. # Attempts made 1.  Asked chatGPT and received several answers without dissent. 2.  Tried commenting out or deleting the DERP content in the Headscale configuration file `config.yaml`. # Requirements 1.  A should connect to B only using Headscale server and not Tailscale DERP server. 2.  Reduce latency and ensure both ends can access through UDP, with latency below 30. ==Can anyone please help me? Thank you.==
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Improve Admin UI docs **Top Level Platform Menu & Side Nav** -> Consistency: "Unchained Admin UI" instead of "Admin UI" We copied the docs initially from https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ They have a "Home" part and once you select one of the productsI you see completely different side nav with the details. Is this doable too instead of having just a link to one of the sections on the left when clicking admin ui? **Ethereum neutral:** http://localhost:8000/admin-ui/currency/ -> Don't use the word "Ethereum" because Unchained could support Solana, Cardano etc. Always stay blockchain-neutral and write something like: If you add a crypto currency, you can optionally configure a contract address that can be used to distinguish tokens on a blockchain. A cryptocurrency payment plugin (for ex. cryptopay) can then optionally read that information and knows which currency is actually meant. **AI help for more elegant texts:** Make sure to use ChatGPT to help you write better text: For example "Unchained engine supports multiple authentication flows users can use to register and access it. The admin ui is designed to support most of this authentication and authorization flows with the exception of some that are better suited to a storefront instead of a control panel." is not very clear and needs further explanation. restructuring the text with chatgpt can help you get more specific for example you can write that although Unchained Engine supports a wider range of auth options like custom login handlers and that the admin ui only supports self-souvereign methods and very popular oAuth providers. **Better explain the different types of products** And also get specific about the product types, there is a lot of questions around that when I discussed this with Joel from Bob Pay, he currently builts a shop based on Unchained Engine for that company as a reference implementation of their service. He also questioned how somebody can set prices and how the default pricing works, and it was not clear for him that a configurable product cannot have prices for example. 
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Strange behaviour.....truncate answer when using another language than English Hi there, First thank you for this amazing app :) I'm having a strange behaviour when using ChatGPT Text. In notes, mail, talk same behaviour, i have truncated answer when not asking something in English  EXAMPLE: (i'm using defaut model text-davinci-003) ``` Question: write a cover letter (English) Answer: OK full ```  ```  Question : ein Anschreiben schreiben (Deutsch) Answer: truncate answer (around 900 -1000 caracters) ```  ```  Question: ecrit une lettre de motivation (French) Answer: truncate answer (around 900 -1000 caracters) ```  Is there a reason for this ? Is it linked to my free OpenAi account ? I try to change model with no success (for gpt-turbo for example, nothing happens when clicking "Generate" button) If i try directly from chat.openai.com it's working flawlessly.. I have no errors at all in the logs. I'm disovering this so it may be a lack of understanding from me. EDIT: Working flawlessly with onlyoffice plugin...with same account Regards

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Why include Embeddings in QueryResponse?  Is there a purpose to always including the embeddings in the QueryResponse? A single ada vector is >20k tokens and per the documentation the whole API response is passed to ChatGPT to be used, that would mean that unless there is filtering of the response happening within ChatGPT top_k has no purpose and most of the API response will be truncated and ignored after the first embedding vector?

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Support multiple distinct UIs ### Prerequisites - [X] I have written a descriptive issue title - [X] I have searched existing issues to ensure the feature has not already been requested ### 🚀 Feature Proposal With ChatGPT plugins depending on OpenAPI specifications, it would be really helpful if there's a simplified way to create at least two distinct OpenAPI specifications and Swagger UI's.  Each version would have to live under distinct URL routes.  They would both consume the same underlying `swaggerObject` but would likely have different `transformSpecification` functions to selectively reveal or hide different routes. Ideally this is done by registering the swagger ui plugin multiple times and configuring them appropriately. Right now this doesn't work because the plugin does some decorations that clash on the second registration. ### Motivation This would make it trivial to run and manage a single server that has an API service that's suitable for OpenAI plugins with a subset of routes supported and a wider set of API routes that are available for other clients, such as a web app. ### Example An example setup could be: ```javascript   await fastify.register(require("@fastify/swagger-ui"), {     routePrefix: "/internal-documentation",     uiConfig: {       docExpansion: "full",       deepLinking: false,     },     uiHooks: {       onRequest: function (request, reply, next) {         next();       },       preHandler: function (request, reply, next) {         next();       },     },     staticCSP: true,     transformStaticCSP: (header) => header,     transformSpecification: internalAPITransformation,     transformSpecificationClone: true,   });   await fastify.register(require("@fastify/swagger-ui"), {     routePrefix: "/external-documentation",     uiConfig: {       docExpansion: "full",       deepLinking: false,     },     uiHooks: {       onRequest: function (request, reply, next) {         next();       },       preHandler: function (request, reply, next) {         next();       },     },     staticCSP: true,     transformStaticCSP: (header) => header,     transformSpecification: externalAPITransformation,     transformSpecificationClone: true,   }); ```

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Use github workflow to run this finder periodically. Not sure if it's appropriate to run the program using Github workflow. If it's appropriate, we can run this automatically, and even save the result json to release. Additionally, we don't have to run the full website in each run, just 10% of it.   This would be an interesting data stats eventually. We can even ask the ChatGPT to generate such workflow script for us. 
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Update the existing shared conversation with updated conversation without changing URL When I export a chat, it get's a unique ID like [yc0o7Ro](https://sharegpt.com/c/yc0o7Ro) this one. I share it with my friend. After that I continue the conversation with ChatGPT in same chat and again re-export the same chat to share the updated chat with my friend. But then I get a new ID like this [idFXxgc](https://sharegpt.com/c/idFXxgc) So I have to share new URL. What I expect is: When I re-export the same conversation, the [yc0o7Ro](https://sharegpt.com/c/yc0o7Ro) should be updated to contain the updated conversation instead of creating new URL. Possible Solution: ChatGPT uses UUIDs for conversations. We can store that UUID in MySQL along with the generated URL [yc0o7Ro](https://sharegpt.com/c/yc0o7Ro) So when next time the same chat is exported, the ShareGPT should just update the existing entry in the Database instead of creating new one.
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Add support for Code Interpreter Plug-in Sharing a conversation of the ChatGPT Code Interpreter plug-in does not properly save the code and execution output to ShareGPT.  See the attached screenshot comparison of ChatGPT vs ShareGPT for the same conversation - you will notice that the "work" drowndown widget containing the code and execution result is missing. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21087424/230469258-4de1ea06-0b90-40bb-8dae-e4f4e89a110c.png)

  <details>     <summary>       <strong>ChatGPT 其实是通用人工智能的对立面</strong>     </summary>     <p>有一种观点认为 <em>人脑是大量神经元组成的神经网络，经过上百万年遗传进化(类似深度学习中的训练)，智力也累计量变而质变，终于实现了所谓的智能。</em></p> <p>但我觉得如果把神经网络的训练比作人类基因的遗传进化，那神经网络就缺少人类真正学习的过程。 比如，人类学会写代码并不是遗传出来的，而是通过接受自然语言形式的知识习得写代码的功能。 我更倾向把神经网络的训练比作个人的学习过程而不是遗传进化。人类遗传进化类似神经网络的一些超参数，例如层深，层的结构..。</p> <p>那么对于 ChatGPT ，很明显。它的学习只能是,<strong>在代码层接受大量数据来调参</strong>。并不能通过它向人类提供的接口而学习。你当然可以对 ChatGPT 告诉它说 "Hi, 从今天起你叫小白，我将用小白来称呼你。"，它也会短暂的记住“小白“是它的名字，但它只是在将 "Hi, 从今天起你叫小白，我将用小白来称呼你。"这句话添加到了输入中，根据输入计算输出来回答你。</p> <p>你不能像教一个姗姗学步的孩子一样，从 1+1=2 一直教到微积分。ChatGPT 没有长期存储模块，当然这只是一方面，其实这也解释了为什么 ChatGPT 只接受 4096 个 Token 。</p> <p>我想定义一个新名词“智力”，<strong>智力是结构的体现，而不是功能的象征，其中结构是功能的元数据，不随功能而改变。智力则决定了功能的上限，也决定了学习的效率</strong>。简单来说，人的智力并不会随着学会新知识而提高。对于同一个人，刚出生的婴儿和大学教授的智力是相同的。类比到深度学习，神经网络的智力在网络结构确定时也已确定，调参只增加它的功能而不是智力。所以人类遗传进化增长的是智力，因为大脑结构已经改变了。神经网络的训练增长的是功能。</p> <p>说会通用人工智能。我理想中的通用人工智能首先应该是一个单机的结构，一个人的智力并不依靠互联网。第二通用人工智能要对外暴露学习接口，自然语言形式是最好的，视觉，听觉都可以，甚至神经网络的调参接口也可以。而 ChatGPT 并没有这样的接口。(所以可以本地跑的 LLM 模型是通用人工智能吗？理论上是的，但它的智力十分低下，你教会一个孩子 1+1=2 ，只需要对他用自然语言说出来就可以，但你教会一个从零开始的 LLM ，不知道要用多少数据，训练多长时间。这就是智力决定学习的效率。) </p> <p>所以一个通用人工智能可以不会写代码，不知道 1+1=2 ，甚至连自己的名字都不知道。但我不介意从零开始指导她(只要她的智力足够高)。而 ChatGPT 正在走一条相反的道路，首先利用海量的计算能力和整个互联网的数据训练一个通晓天地万物的智能机器，但你却没法指导它成为你自己的模样，它属于 OpenAI 却不是你自己。</p> <p>最后我并不质疑 ChatGPT 的价值，无论商业还是科研方面，ChatGPT 都已经成功证明了自己。我只是觉得世上不应该只有 xxGPT ，通用人工智能的道路满是荆棘，但光辉却洒满大地。希望通用人工智能早日实现。</p> <p>一个 AI 小白的碎碎念。(前进提要:<a href="https://www.v2ex.com/t/893146" rel="nofollow">https://www.v2ex.com/t/893146</a>)</p>   </details>     <p>     <a href="https://www.v2ex.com/t/930154">91 comments</a> by

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Does the web support this? Thank you for creating the Awesome Library. Does the web support this? I tried using ChatGPT and it seemed to work fine in Chrome. If you support it, it looks like you should add web below. <img width="619" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6210798/230518852-b77115cc-fe72-4ed0-a87f-5740cf62f16d.png"> 
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Required OpenAI API on deployment Vercel I try to set up with Azure OpenAI API but it's forcing me to use ChatGPT API. Could you make a change to that?
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, AI helper plugin: LLM use to boost understanding and memorization In Chamilo 1.11.20, we introduce learning path assisted building with ChatGPT to help teachers create valuable teaching content of higher quality (through collaboration between teacher and AI). However, this doesn't necessarily go very far in helping learners retain information. In this [tweet](https://twitter.com/_alexbrogan/status/1643965588627226624?s=20), we have a series of prompts that we could implement to "rephrase" the content of a learning path in a way that will make it easier for the student to memorize. I would like to see this added to Chamilo as an extension of the ai_helper plugin that allows the learner to ask for more forms of presentation of the same content. The following is a list of preset prompts that trigger a rephrased content from the LLM service configured in the AI helper plugin. | Method | Prompt | | ---------- | ---------- | | Mind mapping | Explain, in the [language] language, how to create a mind map for [x topic] to visually structure and organize the key concepts, facilitating better understanding and recall. | | Feynman Technique | Demonstrate, in the [language] language, how to apply the Feynman Technique to learn and retain information in [x topic] by simplifying complex concepts and teaching them to others. | | Elaborative interrogation | Describe, in the [language] language, the process of elaborative interrogation and provide examples of how to use this questioning technique to improve information retention in [x topic]. | | spaced repetition | Explain, in the [language] language, how to incorporate spaced repetition into my study routine for [x topic] to enhance long-term memory retention and recall. | | SQ3R Method | Introduce, in the [language] language, the SQ3R Method and demonstrate its application for reading and retaining information from textbooks or articles related to [x topic]. | | Analogies and metaphors | Share, in the [language] language, examples of how to create analogies and metaphors to simplify complex ideas and concepts within [x topic], making them more memorable and easier to understand. | | Dual coding | Explain, in the [language] language, how to combine verbal and visual information using the dual coding theory to enhance understanding and retention of [x topic]. | | Storytelling | Explain, in the [language] language, how to use storytelling techniques to transform abstract concepts in [x topic] into relatable narratives, making them more memorable and easier to understand. | | Thematic connections | Describe, in the [language] language, how to build thematic connections between different aspects of [x topic] to form a coherent mental structure, facilitating easier recall and deeper understanding. | | Interleaved learning | Introduce, in the [language] language, interleaved learning and demonstrate how to apply this technique to study [x topic], mixing related subjects or skills to enhance information retention and transfer. | | Memory palaces | Describe, in the [language] language, how to create a memory palace to help retain and recall complex information from [x topic] by associating key concepts with vivid mental images and locations. | Ideally, I see that as an overlay extensible menu on the top right of learning path pages, allowing you to query ChatGPT for a rewrite of the current topic, based on the title of the learning path and the title of the item. To avoid sending the same queries over and over to ChatGPT, answers should be stored in the plugin tables. The structure of the plugin table could be:  ```   CREATE plugin_ai_helper_stored_prompts(     id int not null AUTO_INCREMENT,     title text,     prompt text   );   CREATE TABLE plugin_ai_helper_stored_lp_item_answer(     id int not null AUTO_INCREMENT,     lp_item_id int not null,     prompt_id int not null,     language_id int not null,     answer text,     user_id int not null,     created_at datetime   ); ``` Where the prompts can be stored in the first table (these could help for other stuff later on). If the helper detects the rephrase has already been requested, it takes it directly from the table. Otherwise it sends the request to the AI service. The widget should only be visible for `lp_item` of type `doc`.
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, prioritize tasks in a task list using chatgpt Add a button to use ChatGPT to suggest top priorities from an existing view of a tasks list.  Basically, automate the following: 1. Given a filtered view of tasks, click the "export" button to get a markdown version of exactly those tasks. 2. In the markdown file, click the ChatGPT button and type "This is my todo list. Any suggestions for what my top priorities should be for today? " in the dialog that appears. 3. Here's what I just got as output when doing this with the todo list I was looking at: <img width="586" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1276278/230665234-0c2c74ca-d570-4277-a9cb-2d288b52114f.png"> My actual visible task list had 12 items on it, and the ones it chose as top priority were in fact very sensible, reflecting the "sentiment" of the text I had written in the tasks.   
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, ChatGPT is able to access private GitHub repositories! ### Describe the bug I tried to ask ChatGPT for information about a private GitHub repository of mine. To my amazement, ChatGPT was able to tell me about the repository perfectly well, with all the details. What is concerning is that it is able to access a private GitHub repository, which shouldn't happen, as it might be looked at as a 'breach of privacy' by others. ### To Reproduce 1. Enter the prompt: "Tell me about the GitHub repo: __repoName__" 2. Then on the prompted to enter username: "Username of Repository owner: __userName__" 3. ChatGpt is able to access the Github repository, and provide information, even though the repository is private. ### Code snippets _No response_ ### OS Windows 11 ### Python version Python v3.7.1 ### Library version openai-python v0.26.4
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, chatgpt: subtle chat issue -- if you refresh your browser *during* a response, it'll never answer despite the progress bar 1. Ask chatgpt something in chat 2. As it starts to answer refresh your browser. 3. It'll never finish answering. The problem is that your browser - which you just refreshed - does the api call to get the response, and of course it'll never start doing that again if you refresh halfway through.    WORKAROUND: Ignore the progress bar, and copy/paste your question and send it again.

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Conversation using chatgpt Thanks for the extension, and sorry if this is the wrong place to post. I was wondering if it is possible to have a conversation with a GPT model using this extension?

An example would be: Break this block into learning points -Learning points Order the learning points based on easiest to hardest to learn -Ordered learning points

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, DLLs named wrong, one is missing? ### Are you using the latest Dosbox-Staging Version? - [X] I have checked releases and am using the latest release. ### Different version than latest? _No response_ ### What Operating System are you using? Windows 10 ### Whats your question and how can we help? Hello. First: Please know that I have no idea what I am doing, this is my first ever build. I have had bing's AI guide me through this process, including installing mingw (apparently for nothing) and msys2. I will be using chatgpt for hopefully small changes to the source beyond the scope of my question and I only want to steal as little of your time as possible. Still, bing suggested I reach out to you, so here I am. Also know that I do not speak C at all, but other languages. The code I've downloaded is the latest from github. Bing told me how to do that. My questions: I've successfully managed to build dosbox-staging. It's in the release-gcc folder. The executable is there, but when I run it, it complains about missing DLLs. Okay, that makes sense, I thought. So I've copied the DLLs from the official installation over, thinking that might work ... but no. So, two problems: (1) "The code execution cannot proceed, because" ... libiir.dll, libmt32emu-2.dll, libopusfile-0.dll, libslirp-0.dll ... "were not found". The DLLs the freshly built program looks for are named differently than the ones the official release uses. That's fine, I've renamed them, but I don't know yet if that actually works, because of (2). Why would they be named differently, though? That makes no sense to me. (2) There is one DLL missing. It's not part of the official release, yet the freshly built one asks for it. "libslirp-0.dll" is not part of the official release, at least not with any name that would allow me to recognize it as such. Why is it required, when it's not part of the official release and where do I find it? I've installed the official release today, btw, maybe two hours ago. I do not know if there are other problems looming, because this is as far as I can get. Can you please clear this up for me and tell me how I can fix this? I have no idea what I'm doing, and I'll be really, REALLY happy when I can leave C behind me again. Thank you and I'm sorry for taking away your time. ### Code of Conduct & Contributing Guidelines - [X] Yes, I agree.
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Thoughts about ChatGPT service for ProgramY Develop a ReST service for ChatGPT / OpenAI / Azure API integration. ## Expected Behavior Use sraix or other integration service paths to integrate with ChatGPT and other GPT style services. ## Current Behavior Not available, but could custom write our own ## Possible Solution Develop service :-) ## Detailed Description Default scenario might be to pass YEMPTY to ChatGPT for further processing if the top level AIML doesnt recognise the text. Some more advanced usage of ChatGPT might require a few interactions with the service to get the desired result. AIML could be used to help manage that flow. Also, with all the existing connectors to different services and clients, it could open up new ground for ProgramY.

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, DroidBot + ChatGPT for easier GUI automation I'd like to introduce an interesting feature that we just started developing. We are trying to support GUI automation with a simple text prompt. For example, given a task prompt "create a contact named Yuanchun“, DroidBot automatically figures out how to complete the task in an app. To achieve this, we use the superpower of ChatGPT-style models. The idea is simple - describing the task, current state, and available actions with natural language, and let ChatGPT make a choice of actions.

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Align human preferences with Alpaca without reinforcement learning We propose a new learning paradigm named RRHF (Rank Responses to Align Human Feedback) which does not need reinforcement learning and can perform on par with PPO to align human preferences. We fine tune Alpaca to Wombat using RRHF by various ChatGPT responses within 2 hours of training. https://github.com/GanjinZero/RRHF
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, It answers, but not in the chat Hi folks, it is working great. The only issue that i have, is that the answers written by chatgpt aren´t shown in the whatsapp chat. I can see them in both cmd-prompts and in the chatgpt-window (i use firefox instead of chromium). Anyone else with this issue and maybe a good workaround to solve it? cheers, MatMax

href="https://github.com/diemus/azure-openai-proxy" rel="nofollow">diemus/azure-openai-proxy</a> ，让很多使用 azure 的小伙伴们可以轻松对接各位大神开发的 web 前端项目，收货了不少 star ，但是也遇到很多朋友反馈 Azure 的服务很难申请，一个是需要美元信用卡，一个是需要公司的身份，最终还是没能申请下来。再加上 4 月份以来 openai 开始大规模封号，国内小伙伴们使用 chatgpt 的难度又上升了不少。所以我就在想，我能不能基于上次开源的代理项目，搞一个接口代理服务，直接让大家人民币付款就完了，于是就有了这么一个项目。</p> <h2>官网地址</h2> <p><a href="https://console.openai-asia.com" rel="nofollow">https://console.openai-asia.com</a></p> <h2>针对人群</h2> <ol> <li> <p>技术人员。可以直接 api 调用，接口和原生 openai 接口完全一致，支持 gpt3.5 ，davinci-003 ，embedding 3 种模型，后续也可能会支持 gpt4 ，可以直接在 langchain 等 python 库里使用，也可以配置到自己喜欢的开源 chatgpt 前端项目中使用。</p> </li> <li> <p>小白用户。提供了基于开源项目搭建的一个默认 chatgpt ，小白用户可以登录后直接使用，无需各种复杂的 API 配置。</p> </li> </ol> <h2>收费</h2> <p>按使用 tokens 数量收费，和 openai 官网算法保持一致，用多少收多少，RMB 付款，最低 1 元起充，没有套路，注册后登录可见各模型具体价格。</p> <h2>功能亮点</h2> <ol> <li>灵活度高，模拟原生 Openai API ，可以在各种 python 库里使用</li> <li>无需复杂配置，打开即用的 ChatGPT</li> <li>默认的 ChatGPT 页面支持 PWA ，可以直接生成桌面应用及手机端应用，媲美原生 App 体验</li> <li>无月租</li> <li>最低 1 元起充，也可以当个备用账号临时使用</li> <li>独立虚拟 sk ，不用担心自己的 sk 在开源项目泄露，这个 sk 只在我们这里有效。</li> <li>无需自己花钱租服务器部署 azure-openai-proxy 代理</li> </ol> <p>其实核心的代理模块已经在 <a href="https://github.com/diemus/azure-openai-proxy" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/diemus/azure-openai-proxy</a> 开源过了，这次的项目只不过是加了一个多租户管理还有多账号负载均衡之类的功能，对于有 Azure 账号的朋友们，建议直接使用我开源的代理就 ok 了</p>

<p>ONEW 是一款账户资产管理应用，旨在帮助用户整合银行账户、信用卡账户和投资账户等信息，方便随时掌握自己的资产情况和资金流动状况。ONEW 不再让用户花费时间进行繁琐的记账，而是专注于提供余额管理，轻松管理个人财务！</p> <h4>为什么开发 ONEW ？</h4> <p>过去我尝试使用过不少记账 App ，甚至还使用 Excel 进行记账，但是我坚持最久的时间应该是一年多左右。一笔笔繁琐的流水，如果忘记记录某一笔支出还会导致账目对不上。最主要是，我发现自己很少回过头去细看流水，每个月的消费情况也都大差不差的。这真的让我很难坚持下来。</p> <p>固定的消费情况，收支流水、消费分类和预算管理这一套记账逻辑，于我个人而言就没啥作用了。现在我只会在支出变动较大的那个月，查看一下信用卡或者支付宝的账单。</p> <p>后来我在一篇公众号文章里，了解到了“余额记账”这一概念。我又再一次做了一个 Excel 表格，列出我所有的账户，然后定期（基本上频率为一个月）更新账户的余额。就这样，我从 17 年底保持记录到了 22 年初。</p> <p>这张表也记录了我的钱从理财产品流向 P2P ，又从 P2P 安全撤出流向证券市场的过程。为什么只记录到 22 年初，一是当时拿出大部份钱付首付，二是当时持仓资产价格不断下跌。钱越来越少，就不太想更新了，大概不更新钱就不会少吧😂。</p> <p>大概在 18 年的时候，接触到了港股打新这个项目。之前的港股打新不同于 A 股，不限制个人申请次数，所以你的券商账户越多收益也就可能越好，慢慢的也开了十个左右的港股账户。</p> <p>越来越多的账户，Excel 也变得越来越难以维护。而且要想实现更多的需求，Excel 也无法满足我，当然也可能是我不太会 Excel 。因此，萌生出开发 App 的念头。其实，大概 4 年前我就找了当时公司的 UI 设计师交流过，但是合作没推进下去，这个开发计划也就搁置了。4 年间每当我想开始 App 开发计划时，都因为 UI 问题而毫无进展。直到 22 年底，我转换了思路，不再追求个性的 UI ，至少先参考系统 App 或者行业 App 把 Demo 给整出来。</p> <h4>现在进展如何？</h4> <p>现在 ONEW 基于“账户-资产”这一维度实现了基本的 CRUD ，然后再进行统计汇总。资产也支持了多币种。所有个人输入数据存在本地，支持 iCloud 同步。</p> <p><img alt="主界面" class="embedded_image" loading="lazy"

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, openai.error.RateLimitError: You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details. (chatgpt free v.) Does this work with chatgpt 3 I'm getting this ratelimit error. I only asked for what the time was to test it. I edited the model in .env to gpt-3 from gpt-3.5 turbo I'm a noob.
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Support for FastAPI's OAuth2PasswordBearer I apologize in advance if this is already possible and I'm just missing it in the auth docs/examples.  FastAPI has built-in support for a simple [OAuth2 password flow](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/security/first-steps/#fastapis-oauth2passwordbearer). It's unclear if/how this should work with ChatGPT plugin auth options as it looks like you require the non-password flow based on the required fields in the manifest (client_url, authorization_url, scope). With the password-based flow I believe only the authorization_url would be used with a username/password in exchange for a token that could be used in subsequent requests. If `OAuth2PasswordBearer` is supported could you please show an example of the right way to use it in a ChatGPT plugin? 
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Support Firefox mobile  I often use ChatGPT on mobile, would be convenient for me to get the same button injected into the mobile site. 
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, ChatGPT integration It would be great to have integration with chatGPT, in two ways: 1. Completion. Similar to github copilot, adding text based on what's already entered. With confirmation by the user. You can do it directly as it's implemented in the GitHub copilot. ChatGPT has a separate api method for completion (https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/completion/introduction).  2. Text transformation. For operations on the whole text or selected chunks. So that you can, for example, select a piece of text, write "turn list into a table" and the result will replace the selected text. You'll have to pick up prompts (you can put them in the settings), but even simple variants show that this can work very well. Even on model version 3.5. For example: ``` System:  I want you to act as a markdown text editor. I will send you markdown text and what to do with it. The text will be separated from the command by the line ---. You will only respond to me with the modified text, in markdown format, without explanations. User:  40 - 2x New CADDX Polar cameras 60 - 2x New CADDX Nebula Pro Nano cameras 90 - 3x New CADDX Nebula Micro cameras --- Before the "-" symbol comes the price. Convert it into a table with columns for price, quantity, and name Assistant:  | Price | Quantity | Name | | --- | --- | --- | | 40 | 2 | New CADDX Polar cameras | | 60 | 2 | New CADDX Nebula Pro Nano cameras | | 90 | 3 | New CADDX Nebula Micro cameras | ```
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Slow query times During the query process where the user can find the answer to their question, the time to obtain the chatgpt response as well as retrieving evidence can be significant. It would be nice to be able to set up the context retrieval and answer creation process more efficiently, similar to the waiting times in [askyourpdf.com](https://askyourpdf.com/).
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, [Suggestion] "ChatGPT: Check comments" It would be great to have an ability to select the comment section and ask ChatGPT to check the grammar, or to make more sense in the comments. For example, I write comments in English language, but it isn't my native language and I make mistakes or I use incorrect words to describe the context. Or, may be, ask it to even write some template first.

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Unusable - Ask ChatGPT button is gone after latest update Before the last update the button was present but it was stuck to the top of the page so I had to scroll everytime to click it. Now the button is gone. In addition, the keyboard shortcut for asking chatgpt doesn't seem to work either. I tried changing it and restarting but no luck. I am using Mac Ventura 13.3.1. Have not tested on other systems.
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, A few "solved" phrases using ChatGPT and a custom algorithm So, i was chatting with ChatGPT about 469 language, and i ended up in a algorithm that gets the inverse matrix for the Hellgate Matrix, and uses that to decode segments of the phrase, and i've come to interesting results while trying to decode common 469 phrases, here's what i've "decoded" so far (it can be wrong, its just that it makes sense based on the output): ============ Avar Tar 469 poem: 29639 46781! 9063376290 3222011 677 80322429 67538 14805394, 6880326 677 63378129 337011 72683 149630 4378! 453 639 578300 986372 2953639! CONGRATULATIONS! YOU HAVE SUCCESSFULLY DECODED THIS MESSAGE, PLEASE PROCEED TO THE NEXT CHALLENGE! I had also said to ChatGPT to solve that in a way that 46781 becomes "BEHOLDER", due to a previous algorithm i was trying giving this result, and another version of the poem: PARTY BEHOLDER! THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG, HELLO WORLD! CATS ARE AWESOME!    Both of these makes a kind of sense, given that "hello world" is a common programming phrase, and that could be a programmer's joke, and this programmer would love cats, also  "THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG" is a phrase that envolves all the alphabet letters and it's used as testing too. ============ ============  Tibia's 15 year event 469 phrase spoke by a NPC  3478 67 90871 97664 3466 0 345!  EYE OF THE BEHOLDER! ============ I will also include a script that ChatGPT wrote for this, however even tho the logic may be right, it's giving errors, and even tho i'm a programmer i'm not a Python expert i will leave it, to see if it helps someone: ```python import numpy as np # Define the inverse encoding matrix inverse_encoding_matrix = np.array([[-1, 1, 1, 0],                                     [1, -2, -1, 2],                                     [0, 1, 0, -1],                                     [-1, 2, 0, 1]]) # Define a function to decode a single word def decode_word(encoded_word):     # Split the encoded word into a list of integers     encoded_list = [int(x) for x in encoded_word]     # Create a 1D NumPy array from the encoded list     encoded_vector = np.array(encoded_list)     # Make sure the encoded vector has the same number of elements as the number of columns in the inverse encoding matrix     encoded_vector.resize((4,), refcheck=False)     # Decode the vector by matrix multiplication with the inverse encoding matrix     decoded_vector = np.dot(encoded_vector, inverse_encoding_matrix)     # Convert the decoded vector to a list of integers     decoded_list = decoded_vector.astype(int).tolist()     # Convert the list of integers to a string of uppercase letters     decoded_word = "".join([chr(x + 65) for x in decoded_list])     return decoded_word # Test the function with the given encoded phrase encoded_phrase = "3478 67 90871 97664 3466 0 345!" words = [decode_word(word) for word in encoded_phrase.split()] decoded_phrase = " ".join(words) print(decoded_phrase) ``` PS: idk why this text is becoming bold/changing size, i hadn't told it to do so, sorry for that
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Not use ChatGPT or API We need it
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Context Does Not Provide Information? Hello, How might I improve response quality's reasoning? Is there a setting, prompt technique, or limitation I need to know more about?  Does this solution lack some sort of access to ChatGPT's training data as context and reasoning capability? I've attached screen shots.  There seems to be a notable difference in response quality when I compare this solution's responses with ChatGPT responses.  Whereas ChatGPT has capacity to reason and improvise within its responses, this solution's responses seem more like web search results.  When I provide the same content as reference and use the same prompt, ChatGPT offers what I consider to be a much higher quality response.  ChatGPT understood what 'urgent vs important' framework meant, without my assistance, and applied that framework to the reference material. By contrast, this solution seems to be focused on where literal relevance in uploaded documents might be found. Thank you for sharing this solution with the community. I am encouraged by its potential.  <img width="869" alt="vaultop-response" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100360244/233371055-c1a6109c-a630-42a6-a1d0-c9f87cba5a61.png"> <img width="591" alt="chatgpt-response" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100360244/233371094-8cfb8789-dc55-4082-ab84-fed2f94a77ae.png"> 
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Big thanks for this project, it is really great for parsing json from AI! Thank you for creating the best python library for parsing messy json on the web! :) Thought you might find it interesting that my use case is if you are using an ai chatbot like chatgpt to generate json, it often adds random text before, after or in the json, and is just generally not very respectful of the json spec lol. Also sometimes it gets cutoff in generating json by the context limit so you are left with half of a json object with all the closing brackets missing. So far dirtyjson has done a great job of handling almost all of this. Only suggestion might be if there was some extra handling around half cutoff json blobs and a best effort attempt to try and turn it into a valid json object. There is a npm module that focuses more on fixing badly terminated json, might offer some inspiration if you are interested: https://github.com/josdejong/jsonrepair Overall mostly just wanted to say thanks! I was trying to write regex to parse out the json and was tearing my hair out but dirtyjson handled most of my problems on the first try.

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Integrate lfortran with an LLM Integrating a Fortran compiler with a large language model, as I suggested at https://groups.google.com/g/comp.lang.fortran/c/GVASMUKv_Ww , would be interesting. That post is copied below. I have asked ChatGPT to write Python and Fortran codes to solve some problems, and often it produces working code, but sometimes it produces Fortran code that does not compile. It would be great to have a ChatGPT wrapper with access to a free compiler such as gfortran and more broadly to all the compilers in gcc. The workflow would be (1) Ask the ChatGPT wrapper a programming question. (2a) If ChatGPT answers without producing code, transmit the answer to the user. (2b) If it does produce code in Fortran or C++ etc., try to compile with gfortran, g++ etc. (2bi) If the code compiles, transmit the answer with code to the user. (2bii) If the code does not compile, send the error message to ChatGPT, which hopefully it can fix, after which the answer with code is transmitted to the user. The basic idea is to improve ChatGPT so that it does not send the user code that does not compile. One could extend this by having the ChatGPT wrapper not just compile but run the codes it generates and test if it satisfies the user's requirements. For example, the user could say "write a Fortran function called 'sorted' in module 'sorted_mod' that sorts integers, and test it with a program use sorted_mod implicit none if (all(sorted([5,4,2]) == [2, 4, 5]) then print*,"success" else print*,"failure" end if end" There is a project https://github.com/mherrmann/fix using ChatGPT to fix C++ programs.

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, feature:Inferring UI from a chatGPT prompt I realize our goal for trying to stay true to good-old Hypercard, but a UI by inference would be a cutting-edge approach for Wyldcard to build user interfaces that leverages natural language processing and machine learning techniques to generate UI elements on the fly based on text input. With UI by inference, developers can create highly flexible and customizable conversational interfaces that can adapt to a wide range of use cases, without the need for manual UI design or coding. By empowering users to interact with technology using natural language, UI by inference represents the next frontier in user interface design.  I realize there are challenges, like layout templating and the like, but here is one way we can do it:  Provided we have integrated ChatGPT, take a prompt as input, parse it into object(s), nouns, adjectives and propositions using the Stanford NLP library, and then building a script that creates a memory-resident card (or a persistent one, depending on use case) for that object, then show it to the user for input, and finally build and pass the response back out to ChatGPT for further processing.

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Feature: Automate Copy-Paste Human mode with AutoChatGPT Recently there was a feature added allowing to copy-paste from ChatGPT to avoid spending OpenAI credits. It can be automated with browser extension, here is a minimal example I made, where two instances of ChatGPT communicate, but we can make replace second instance in example with babyagi. https://github.com/7flash/AutoChatGPT

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, [Feature Request]: Images and batch images for Controlnet input ### Is there an existing issue for this? - [X] I have searched the existing issues and checked the recent builds/commits ### What would your feature do ? It would be great to be able to use a single image or directory of images for controlnet instead of simply video files. The thinking behind this would be to stylize a video like a single image, or use a batch of images to get more control over the frames. Maybe make looping images etc.  ### Proposed workflow Checkbox for "image" then changes video path to image directory or path ### Additional information This may also be relevant https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/12wskzx/controlnet_extension_now_natively_supports/ ### Are you going to help adding it? Can help with testing I guess :) otherwise not sure you want me wading into this with chatgpt

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, tiktoken should include function num_tokens_from_messages() Hi, Instead of asking users top copy&paste num_tokens_from_messages() from cookbook examples to deal with ChatGPT models, the tiktoken library should provide one, so handling of any new tokens would be in one place without users having to update their code - instead they will need to update the tiktoken library). Also the function should be stripped from any print() messages. Additionally there should be a more general function get_tokens(prompt, model) which would detect if promot is a list or a string and automatically do the right thing.
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Add lazyshell as plugin ### If the feature request is for a plugin or theme, specify it here. ChatGPT Plugin ### If the feature solves a problem you have, specify it here. [lazyshell](https://github.com/not-poma/lazyshell) basically queries ChatGPT for commands. It is an insanely good command lookup tool. Think of all the silly little commands you muck up (find!!!!! I always forget find syntax. Or JSON parsing using jq!). It has some really neat features, such as being able to include the existing command into your ChatGPT query. https://blog.billyc.io/chatgpt-and-zsh-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-ai/ ### Describe the proposed feature. allow to use lazyshell easily as ohmyzsh plugin ### Describe alternatives you've considered tried to install it manually but no success, due to new to ohmyzsh :) ### Additional context _No response_ ### Related Issues _No response_

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, [Good First Issues]: Refactor `EscapeRegex` Method # Description We plan to refactor the `EscapeRegex` method in our project's code base to improve its readability. This method will be called when we check if the user has permission to perform an action on a specific resource. https://github.com/featbit/featbit/blob/a37477e6430474fcd3d9b88687f3fdb7c80769c8/modules/back-end/src/Domain/Resources/ResourceHelper.cs#L20-L23 Four tasks need to be done - Move this method to a `StringHelper` class - The original regex string is hard to read (too many backslash), use [verbatim string](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/strings/#verbatim-string-literals) `@"([.*+?^=!:${}()|[\]/\\])"` and `@"\$1"` instead. - Add a comment to explain the regular expression in this code (We suggest using ChatGPT or [regexr](https://regexr.com/) to explain this regex string) - Add tests for `EscapeRegex` method (We suggest using ChatGPT to generate tests or test cases) # Scope - Service:API - Location: modules/back-end/src/Domain/Resources/ResourceHelper.cs # Deadline We usually give 2 weeks for a feature request, which means you have 2 weeks to implement the feature starting from the day it is assigned to you. If you have any difficulties, please contact us in [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/featbit/shared_invite/zt-1ew5e2vbb-x6Apan1xZOaYMnFzqZkGNQ). # How to implement 1. Fork the FeatBit repository. 2. Create a branch issues-{issues number} 3. Implement the task based on Description and Scope mentioned above.  4. Submit your PR # Contribution points Each contribution counts a certain number of points, depending on its difficulty. Contributors earn the appropriate points when the work is merged. Contribution points are used to describe the contributions that contributors have made. They can also be used to receive rewards for community events.

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Set up infrastructure for initial integration with ChatGPT - [ ] Introduce a feature toggle `CHATGPT` - [ ] Introduce a config parameter for the API key - [ ] Create a plan for the UI implementation. Queries: - Is this requirement valid according to EARS syntax?
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Add data analysis We used to have an analysis section but I removed it because it was unmaintained. I'm thinking the benchmarks could also output a JSON/YAML version, and we could pass that into ChatGPT to generate an analysis that recommends a minifier for different use-cases. It should probably live in a different GitHub Action, because generating the benchmarks is quite expensive (40 min), and we wouldn't want the action to fail due to an API error (which happens often).

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, check  to use chatgpt X times in a day It would be great if we can implement a system to make a user use chatgpt for like 20 times in a day and that would reset every day. and if they want to upgrade, they can from pro or premium with more uses of chatgpt in a day.

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Is there some way of storing the response in e.g an attribute? Hi, I would like to have HA read the ChatGPT responses through TTS using a media player. Is that possible somehow, e.g. to write the response to an attribute of an entity, where there isn't a 250 character limit.
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, How to select which characters are sent to the API ? Hello and thanks again for the great work, Is the whole file, the whole last paragraph, the whole last sentence transmitted to ChatGPT to generate the completion ? Would it be possible to select what is sent to the API by selecting it, using another way ? Best regards
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Queue adapter interface is not documented or tested The queue adapter (typically accessed by [`state.queue_adapter`](https://github.com/pyiron/pyiron_base/blob/b97221d499502ba46c58a2195a4a5b236782419c/pyiron_base/state/__init__.py#L66)) got spun off to its own package, pysqa, some time ago. It's now [imported](https://github.com/pyiron/pyiron_base/blob/b97221d499502ba46c58a2195a4a5b236782419c/pyiron_base/state/queue_adapter.py#L12) and [used](https://github.com/pyiron/pyiron_base/blob/b97221d499502ba46c58a2195a4a5b236782419c/pyiron_base/state/queue_adapter.py#L58) as the standard non-None queue adapter, although in principle future devs could import a different one from somewhere else and use it. So far this is all good. I think it's great we spun it off, and @jan-janssen has just done a flurry of activity improving test coverage on that package. What I find missing now is (a) a clear definition of the interface pyiron_base is expecting from an adapter, and (b) tests to make sure that interface is maintained.  We recently ran into some trouble at an intermediate stage of #1082, where `state.queue_adapter.submit_job` got passed a set of `**kwargs` even though the underlying class, `pysqa.QueueAdapter.submit_jobs` doesn't accept arbitrary kwargs! This didn't raise a single red flag in pyiron_base, and I really had to go digging in the pysqa package to find the expected interface. The queue adapter is certainly not the only place this comes up, but in general when pyiron imports some object and then uses it extensively, I think it would be nice if we documented somewhere what our expectations were for that object's interface, and, ideally, test it -- either with some proper mock up, or even just with `inspect` to verify that objects have the methods/attributes with think they do, and that the signatures we pass on calling methods are an acceptable subset of the actual method signature. E.g. if I run a find-in-files search for `adapter.` in pyiron_base, I get 32 occurrences, all of which are for `state.queue_adapter`. I couldn't fit them all on screen, but here's a most of the list: <img width="546" alt="Screen Shot 2023-05-04 at 10 15 09" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20283329/236285780-a31d8b22-ddd8-40c6-b9ad-c2c0f4204f4f.png"> So I would propose that somewhere in the code we have a docstring that reads something like the following: ```python """ Any queue adapter used should satisfy the following interface: Takes an instantiation: - directory (str) Has attributes: - remote_flag (bool) Has methods with the following signatures: - get_job_from_remote   - working_directory (str)   - delete_remote (bool) -- default False. - ... - submit_job:   - queue (Optional[str])   - job_name (Optional[str])   - working_directory (Optional[str])   - cores (Optional[int])   - memory_max (Optional[int])   - run_time_max (Optional[int])   - dependency_list (Optional[list[str]])   - command (Optional[str])   - **kwargs """ ``` I'm just providing some sparse examples here because actually filling it out would be a bit of leg work and I wanted to get feedback before putting time in (@samwaseda I know your last adventure with ChatGPT didn't end so well, but do you think this might be a task well-suited to that tool). How/where should we clarify our interface expectations to future devs? I could see this fitting in docstrings, but also having a home in a spec doc somewhere else. How much depth is required? IMO (kw)arg name and type is already pretty helpful, even though it's minimal, but should we also say things like what the expectations are for the _behaviour_ of these methods. This is also not something that needs to happen all at once, but as we run into classes where we're like "hey, we import this and have all sorts of implicit expectations on the imported object", it would be nice to make those expectations explicit. Pushback? Additions?
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, How to Keep The Conversation Going? I have a use case where I have a large set of categories, (around 1000 tokens), I want to send it one time, then ask ChatGPT to categorize company x, company y, etc.. from the categories set I have sent already. The point is to reduce the cost of sending a fresh new prompt with the categories set every time. How can I implement this?

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Detect ChatGPT Response Completion To improve the ChatGPT automation using Selenium and undetected-chromedriver, we need to add a feature that can detect when a ChatGPT response is completed, allowing us to retrieve the output accurately. ## Background Currently, it's challenging to determine when the ChatGPT response is completed, as the text is streamed to the browser. We need a reliable method to detect when the response is finished, so we can obtain the output without resorting to inefficient techniques like `time.sleep`. ## Proposed Solution There are several methods that could be implemented to detect the response completion: 1. Use JavaScript's `MutationObserver` to observe changes in the response element, and trigger a callback when the response is completed. 2. Check for changes in the `div` class of the response element (e.g., from "result-streaming" to "markdown"). 3. Use `invisibility_of_element_located` to wait for the streaming response element to become invisible. ## Acceptance Criteria - Implement a reliable method to detect when a ChatGPT response is completed. - Ensure the implemented method works accurately and efficiently. - Update the automation script to use the new method. ## Tasks - [ ] Evaluate the available methods and select the most suitable one. - [ ] Implement the chosen method in the ChatGPT automation script. - [ ] Test the updated script to ensure the response detection works as expected.

<details>     <summary>       <strong>来海南工作一个月，聊一聊这的工作和生活</strong>     </summary>     <h1>工作</h1> <p>首先说说待遇，待遇其实比在深圳的时候高了不少，公积金也是全额顶格交，不过这也导致转正前到手的薪资和之前差不多。除了公司的待遇，政府还有住房补贴，本科生能拿 3 年的 1250 一个月的补贴。 其次说说工作作息，早 9 晚 6 中午休息两个小时，刚来的时候因为是新项目启动赶时间加了不少班，现在恢复正常之后，工作节奏就很舒服了。由于不打卡，早上同事九点半到的也有，通常早会都是九点半以后开，如果开发任务完成了的情况下，早会也不会要求开发每个人汇报。公司是扁平化管理，PM 也就是管进度，能很明显的感受到和深圳公司的文化差异，在深圳的时候项目管理上是很明显的上下级关系，这边的话属于按时完成了你的任务就没有人在意你在做什么。</p> <h1>住房以及通勤</h1> <p>先说说地理位置，由于不在市区，住当地的话 1300 左右就能租到两室一厅的小区，如果要省钱还有一房或者是农民自建房可以租，我租的是公司附近的小区，包括电梯上下楼通勤走路也就是十分钟，住的小区较好，所以也贵一些，1800 两室一厅带所有家电。由于住得近以及刚来所以也没买电动车，通常都是走路上班，中午回家休息，由于太热有的时候骑共享电动，2.5 元一次。如果住远一点的小区可以自己买个电动车，或者直接买电动汽车也行，员工园区停车是免费的，小区停车也是免费。</p> <h1>生活娱乐以及吃什么</h1> <p>娱乐生活的话是这边最大的缺点，地处偏僻，除了软件园和小区比较新，其实就跟乡下差不多，吃的没多少，基本是大排档，也没有深圳那种商场或者是装修很好的饭店，还有个小吃街不少摆摊的就是。 玩的话，只能去海口，有车的话方便点，一个小时能到，高铁也行，高铁快的那趟半个小时不到。如果不去海口玩，本地的话没有 ktv （在我看来破旧不堪等于没有）、也没有脱口秀或者其他的娱乐活动了。有一个万达影城、一个剧场，一个体育馆，一共两家商业健身房，我暂时是直接在公司的小健身房运动。下班后一般我就是回去打游戏了，偶尔约新认识的朋友打乒乓球、羽毛球，周末偶尔去泳池泡水，这些这边在小区或者园区都能找到免费的场地，如果希望更好的体验可以去体育馆，好像也很便宜（ 10 块左右一次），但是我没去，距离住的地方有三四公里。</p> <h1>感受</h1> <p>是一个很养老的地方，公司使用的技术其实都是最新的，项目不会很难也不会特别简单，没有历史包袱，项目这块其实还算契合我的期望。优点就是轻松，包括通勤以及工作节奏带来了大把的空闲的时间。缺点是生活比较简单单调，没有深圳的生活丰富，也暂时缺乏很知心的朋友，一个人的话会略显孤独，如果是拖家带口或者带着对象一起到这样的城市工作的话我相信体验是比在一线好一点的。</p>

<summary>       <strong>最近一些事情包括看 V 站上的不少评论我感觉我和一些人还是比较适合计划经济。</strong>     </summary>     最近 V 站上有不少的诈骗案例，而老年人诈骗就更不用说了。其实根源上解决还是得搞公有制，例如老年人为什么容易被诈骗。现在学界已经有研究表明了老年人大脑怀疑的机制其实是会退化的，所以老年人上当受骗是常事。哪怕不被境外诈骗骗走也日常在各种保健品营销里面细水长流的弄走。<br><br>而反诈工作这个我也接触过，碰到相当多的人已经被“控制”住了，也就是社区工作人员或者其他的把当事人劝住看住，结果人打个车跑到隔壁城市把钱打了。打完之后立马幡然醒悟，被骗的不少都是如此。<br><br>就生活水平而言，我也没什么特别的消费需求，衣食住行我个人也是很简单，手机嘛不知不觉已经用了三年了，电脑不用说都是 e3 神教现在还没想着升级，所以真要搞公有制其实没什么意见。而最主要的还是在诈骗的帖子下面看到不少人支持没什么用的反诈中心，这个可以说也是让我确信了确实我和一些人都更适合计划经济，现在超级计算机的算力也高了，说不定是可行的。<br><br>在我看来，自由主义践行某种立场总是会伴随某些代价。正如当年设计互联网协议时特地保障的绝对的隐私但互联网上脏恶的东西肯定是不少。通过某些制度也许会减轻这些代价，但正如美国人每年被印度人诈骗这么多钱过去一样，可见的未来还是无法避免的。很多人既要又要的心态在我看来不如躺平迎接

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toLowerCase') I am receiving the following error message: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toLowerCase')". This error message is causing the plugin to become unusable. The error first appears as "The Ask ChatGPT button failed to mount. You can still use the Ask ChatGPT command/shortcut to interact with the page." After this, when I try to use the keyboard shortcut, I receive the error "Cannot read...", and the plugin stops working.

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Create dbt Documentation and Testing 10x faster with ChatGPT ### Contact Details pedro@hellosage.com ### I have read the dbt Developer Blog contribution guidelines. - [X] I have read the dbt Developer Blog contribution guidelines. ### Which of these best describes you? - [X] I am a dbt Community member or partner contributing to the Developer Blog - [ ] I work for dbt Labs and am creating this issue for a community or marketing approved piece. ### What is the topic of your post? Whether you are creating your pipelines into dbt for the first time or just adding a new model once in a while, good documentation and testing should always be a priority for you and your team. But good documentation and testing is time-consuming and a hassle to write. This blog post provides a set of simple guidelines to leverage ChatGPT in order to automate most of the work in generating the YAML files with model descriptions and tests. ### Link to an initial outline. I have shared my experience with using ChatGPT to generate docs and tests with my assigned dbt Solution Architect Luis Leon (luis.leon@dbtlabs.com) and he suggested that I write this blog post. Happy to change the form and content in any way you see fit. This doc has several page but it's mostly due to very large images and tables of results. Actual content is < 1000 words and easily "trimmable". https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gdrLOyCxuTs7JvGVCzrOV9_JcsLrSp0FHivVTR22rTQ/edit?usp=sharing
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Unable to Save Data Using ChatGPT Retrieval Plugin with Memory Enabled I've followed the instructions on the [ChatGPT Retrieval Plugin with Memory GitHub page](https://github.com/openai/chatgpt-retrieval-plugin/tree/main/examples/memory) to enable memory for the retrieval plugin. This involved copying the contents of openapi.yaml and ai-plugin.json from the example into the main files of the same names. After enabling memory, I've been able to successfully perform queries. However, I'm encountering issues when trying to save data into my database through the plugin. Specifically, when I try to use prompts to save data, the plugin seems to treat these as queries instead of upsert operations. Here's a screenshot of the issue I'm encountering: ![Screenshot 2023-05-14 at 08 23 20](https://github.com/openai/chatgpt-retrieval-plugin/assets/43685774/cee5c1d7-b853-4cbf-979b-38987679d957) I'm looking for any tips or guidance on how to resolve this issue. Has anyone else encountered this problem and found a solution? 
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Context-aware lookups with ChatGPT Sometimes words have many definitions and the context determines which to use. For example: くむ【組む】 〘v5m〙 1 to cross (legs or arms); to link (arms). 2 to put together; to construct; to assemble; to produce (e.g. TV program). 3 to braid; to plait. 4 to grapple; to wrestle. 5 to unite; to join; to link up; to form an alliance. 6 to set (e.g. type). 7 to issue (e.g. money order). ChatGPT can get a context aware definition for words by either generating it itself or if it's fed a list of definitions (like above) select the most relevant one, potentially providing an explanation with it.  This can also help with words that are not in a dictionary, since chatGPT has general knowledge outside the dictionary. Additionally, for really difficult sentences, you could also have it break down and explain the whole sentence.

<strong>矫情一下，被体制内的高中同学针对了，其他朋友都在看戏，该怎么办呢？</strong>     </summary>     <p>本人已经 30+ 了，可以称我为 Q ，那么我的高中同学们也是，基本上都结婚或者有孩子了。</p> <p>稍微矫情一下。</p> <p>事情是这样的：</p> <p>我有个高中同学（同学），就称他为 Y 吧，高中时候玩的不错，不过就是一起去网吧、玩完一起吃饭。同行的还有 4-5 个人，高考毕业后几乎每天都去网吧打 dota 。上了大学后，大家都各奔东西了，但是还有个群有一句每一句的聊着。</p> <p>然后一直相安无事到大家大学毕业工作。Y 是国防生、爸爸又是大校军衔，所以就顺理成章去部队当兵了。我呢就去了互联网公司。结果我去了互联网公司，发了定位朋友圈之后，一切都变了。</p> <p>Y 就不遗余力的在朋友圈和群里说：Q 年薪 XX 万，太牛逼了。我比不了比不了。</p> <p>整个群里面一开始都觉得是朋友之前开玩笑。但是后来很多事情就失控了：</p> <ul> <li>Y 经常会艾特其他朋友，说你怎么不找 Q 内推呢，兄弟应该会帮一把的吧</li> <li>Y 经常会分享知乎上分析互联网大厂薪资的贴子，拔高 N 个职级套在我头上，说我毕业 2 年阿里 P8, 年薪 200w ，然后天天直接称呼我为阿里 p8 了。（就连他的 LOL 的小号，都是各种 P8 的字符）</li> <li>Y 后来因为自身问题退伍了，被家里人弄到省卫健委，拿了一笔退伍费，天天开始秀自己的奢侈品。我的老婆发过任何好玩的东西，都会被他在群里一顿嘲讽，说好有钱牛逼牛逼</li> <li>Y 拜托他在我公司的好友，查到了我的工作地、工位号、工资、职级。在群里公布</li> </ul> <p>Y 公布我工作信息的那段时间，我正好打球受伤了，躺在医院做手术。当时就感觉这个同学真的是对我的人生有副作用了。想断绝关系。</p> <p>但是我又舍不得同一个群里的其他高中同学，这里里面有一起奋战高考的战友、还有一起去同一个大学的死党。但是呢，他们就一直像看戏一样看我和 Y 在群里文斗。我也跟这些朋友私下里说过我的担忧，这些朋友的意思是：多个朋友多条路，你太紧张了。群里线下活动的时候，所有人都会提前问我，如果 Y 去了，我会不会有困扰。我就感觉我即被 Y 针对，也被其它人当做异类了。</p> <p>所以，我该怎么办呢？现在 Y 在群里常常分享自己在体制内的人脉：今天又有什么通知了、明天又要和谁吃饭了。其它人也是比较友好的回应。Y 在嘲讽我，公布我信息的时候，也没人站出来帮我说话。</p> <p>那么，我该怎么办呢，退群吗？还是忍受呢，感觉挺困扰的，感觉这高中三年白交那么多朋友了。</p>   </details>     <p>     <a href="https://www.v2ex.com/t/940625">288 comments</a> by <a

<p>如果只是你们口中说的言论自由，哪个国家都一样。工作中，我不信国外的工作比国内轻松啊，可能是一些权益方面，国外会比较好一点，但真是这个原因吗？你只要保持中立，以及没有上升的意愿，躺平还是可以的。你不喜欢的工作也是随时可以换，并非强制。在法律允许的范围内，想做什么也都可以。</p> <p>总感觉在这里一股子移民气，好像润出国就获得了人生自由。。。</p> <p>请各位 V

 </summary>     <p>23 届实习生在沿海二线城市找到了一份 Go 开发的工作，实习月薪 3K ，每天 8 小时不加班+双休。</p> <p>我进的公司项目是数据灾难备份系统，系统使用微服务搭建而成。</p> <p>·问题 1：开发了几年的微服务项目在没有开发文档的情况下，作为新人来说有点难以了解项目各个组件下的详细功能，导致开发有点困难，对项目有疑问还得找人问，且不一定有空回答你。</p> <p>·问题 2：开发没有需求文档，描述模糊，一句话的事情，说完让你自己去想。</p> <p>·问题 3：项目使用的微服务框架是由一个已经不在维护的 Go 微服务框架修改而成，加上自己写的各种工具链组合（用起来有点难受）。使用这个框架开发不确定后续跳槽的时候会不会有什么问题，面试官问你用什么框架，你说 xxxx ，面试官蒙了，还有这框架。框架文档有，但是文档的排版和更新这个就不做评价。</p> <p>问题一的话我可以理解，由于开发人员少，再加上公司没有对这种开发文档要求，估计就懒得做了。项目还在开发阶段，感觉项目负责人也是第一次这种类型的项目，对项目规划不太好，写完文档可能隔几周或者一个月就要重写很多地方，写开发文档就可能会拖慢进度。问题二应该是很多公司项目都共有的毛病吧。</p> <p>我也有自身问题，技术不强，学历普二本，真实项目开发经验少，沟通和理解方面不是很好，对微服务基本没有任何概念（在学习），对这个项目的框架不熟练。</p> <p>所以在这个求职环境下，该忍还是润？</p>   </details>     <p>     <a href="https://www.v2ex.com/t/940576">100 comments</a> by <a

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, A Visually Impaired User's Request for Assistance with ChatGPT Account Access Hello! I am a visually impaired user (blind), and my main purpose of using ChatGPT software is to explore the prospects of the software in visual assistance. This software is very important to me, it helps me understand the information I want to know in an unprecedented way. For example, in the process of programming, I often encounter places that I don't understand or make mistakes. Due to my visual impairment, it is relatively inefficient for me to find answers through search engines, and some content is presented in the form of pictures. However, ChatGPT interacts with me in a conversational way and provides me with text descriptions so that I can immediately hear the information and knowledge I need through a screen reader. This conversational interaction makes me feel very excited and satisfied. However, a few months ago I encountered some problems. I found that I could not log in and showed that I had no permission. I was very confused because in my impression, I had never done any inappropriate behavior. I hope you can understand my situation and help me solve this problem. If you need to provide any additional information or documents, I am willing to cooperate. In addition, in future use, I will continue to use ChatGPT and API in accordance with regulations. I will abide by OpenAI's usage regulations and maintain a good network environment. Thank you for your help and look forward to your reply🍻.
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Regarding continue generation using API ### Describe the bug I have been using OpenAI API key for long time. When I give some question to the model, call the API and it'll return the answer, sometimes it won't return the complete answer due to token issues. Recently, I saw that ChatGPT has come up with new feature, continue generation, where if i click on that, it is continuing the generation in the same block. Below is the picture, ![image](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/assets/129744879/0af55588-2ad3-4a9b-9825-97fbefa7eea3) Is there any way to do that for the API code as well? ### To Reproduce 1. Completion of the answer 2. Limitation of tokens  ### Code snippets ```Python import openai messages = [     {"role": "system", "content": "You are a kind helpful assistant."}, ] while True:     message = input("User : ")     if message:         messages.append(             {"role": "user", "content": message},         )         chat = openai.ChatCompletion.create(             model="gpt-3.5-turbo", messages=messages         )          reply = chat.choices[0].message.content     print(f"ChatGPT: {reply}")     messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": reply}) ``` ### OS WindowsOS ### Python version Python 3.8.5 ### Library version latest version

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Add CommuniqAI Great list!  I think my app applies for the README.  While it initially uses a default API key, enabling message generation for more than one person prompts for an OpenAI API key.

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Make without use of API Key. ``` Hi I generated the following code: Error: {     "error": {         "message": "You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.",         "type": "insufficient_quota",         "param": null,         "code": null     } } ``` This should work without Key, You can use Javascript to do same thing in ChatGPT Website itself. I was looking forward to it to use ChatGPT Website and not external API.

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Display the content generated by ChatGPT in real-time Displaying the content generated in real-time rather than waiting for the whole content can help user to interact with the plug-in more efficiently and save much time in some cases, which feature is provided in the similar plug-in https://github.com/logancyang/obsidian-copilot.   Leaving the uncomplete content unformated during the generation is just okay I personally think.

<strong>求助一个可行的隔音方案</strong>     </summary>     目前整租的房子隔音不太好（但是其他方面住的都很满意，所以不太想换地方住）<br>我的床头的那面墙隔壁是一对情侣，每天晚上 10 点左右开始就会比较吵（聊天，大笑，放歌，深度交流等），一直会持续到 12 点半到 1 点钟，有时会更晚，比如偶尔凌晨 2 ，3 点我会被吵醒<br>五一期间我和房东反映了这件事，之后向物业投诉，大概有 1 周的时间他们比较安静。从上周开始又变回老样子了，虽然我能感觉到他们有稍微注意音量，但由于隔音效果确实很差，而且想睡觉的时候突然有比较响的声音（比如说他们有什么好笑的事情突然大笑一声）导致我很难入睡<br>我尝试过的方法和现状：<br>1 ，之前买过一些耳塞，虽然隔音效果还是不错，但是睡觉带着还是有点不舒服；<br>2 ，房间比较小，比较难改变床的位置，在床尾睡也基本不解决问题；<br>3 ，放过一些白噪音，尽管很放松但是没法听着白噪音睡觉（我承认我的入睡条件有点苛刻。。）<br>现在想在墙上贴隔音棉，看了一圈评论大部分都说没什么用，想来这里咨询一下各位这东西是不是智商税<br>或者还有没有别的方案，谢谢各位   </details>     <p>     <a

分享我最近的面对的问题，真心求建议！谢谢大家了</strong>     </summary>     <h1>背景介绍</h1> <p>我是一个已经结婚两年多的工作了五年的安卓开发。 </p> <p>目前面临的问题需要的介绍都在第一句话了。 一类婚后问题， 一类是职业发展问题。 </p> <p>真心求大家的一些看法和建议。在这先谢谢了。 </p> <p>先说婚后的问题吧。 </p> <h2>婚后问题</h2> <p>我是江西的，自己谈的女朋友，互相是初中同学。 我大专学历，她初中没毕业。这句话没对学历上的看法。 只是有时候确实因为教育经历不同， 很多时候不同频。 所以有必要提一下。 </p> <p>我在前两年结婚了，江西的彩礼你们知道的，20 万，回 3 万。 目前还欠 5 万没给。 因为彩礼的事情，从结婚前吵到结婚后。一直一直吵。 因为这个弄得很难受。 </p> <p>彩礼是他哥收的，因为她爸爸是聋哑人，所以他家他哥说了算，他哥很强势，教育水平也不高、但因为他父母情况、所以他家他做主、什么都是他一个人说了算、甚至谈彩礼、两家人坐一起的时候、她父母都没来、来的只是他哥和他们家的一些亲戚。他第一次来我家，就在背后对我老婆说我父母很平庸这个那个，他自己也只是普通上班的，工薪阶层，让我很不爽。特别是那那一副全家人都要听的样子。</p> <p>婚前她习惯听他的哥，反正发生了很多事情，让我很不爽。</p> <p>因为欠的五万块钱是打欠条的，前年过年我们没给，他还发欠条给我老婆看，问我老婆是什么看法。让我很不爽。 去年过年也没给， 因为去年发生过一次闹离婚（回老家办离婚。 最后因为我们希望退回原来的一些彩礼，（其实也没真要退回，只是有这个意思）和我很容易对她心软，没有离成。），所以我爸妈不敢给，也不太想给，因为我们经常吵架、闹离婚，孩子也还没有。 所以我爸妈暂时没给剩下的。 去年过年前他还想来要，然后我和我老婆又因为这个事情吵架。 我就直接一个电话过去骂了他一顿。 真的看他不爽很久了。 很早就想骂他了。过了几天，他想过来把我老婆接回去，还当着我老婆的面对我爸动了手。 </p> <p>我对她好的看法：</p> <p>善良，可爱，有孝心。当然善良是对别人，对我只能说是一般。</p> <p>我对她不好的看法：</p> <p>经常对我不耐烦、没安全感，不信任，有时候甚至真的是不喜欢，讨厌。 经常说起来就一直说个不停， 然后我被说烦了，受不了，就吼人了（我知道吼人不对， 但真的一直说个，说我这个没做好，那个没做对，说我反应迟钝，傻嫩嫩，说什么男的都是下半身思考的，天天想那个事，以后一定会出轨，说不要孩子，不想带孩子，不想做家庭主妇什么的，脑子都嗡嗡难受的）。 基本都是这个剧情。 我会忍，也会退让，会往她的想法靠，甚至就是直接听她的。但这样，经常说我这样，说我那样。 经常弄的很难受。 还有一点，我必须承认，我确实喜欢高一些的，她是一米五一些。</p> <p>她对我不好的看法：</p> <p>没主见、没趣、没意思、不注意生活细节、不会生活、不懂浪漫、不会照顾人、不会疼人等等。</p> <p>我们对生活的规划不一致：</p> <p>我可能希望在一线城市再打拼打拼，看看机会，不太想回家暂时。 因为我回去我也不知道做什么。 但她比较希望能够回老家生活，工作。 </p> <p>因为离婚这个事情说过很多次了，很多次也买票了，回家了，有时候是买了票又退了，没回去办离婚，和好了。这次也是一样， 我现在真的不知道应该怎么面对离婚这个事情，离还是不离。特别是因为彩礼那些发生了很多不愉快的事情，现在也还要面对那五万块钱的事情。</p> <p>写起来，突然写了这么多。 关于这个婚后问题的大概情况就是这些了。 </p> <p>我面临的问题是： </p> <p>1 、离婚还是不离婚</p> <p>2 、如果不离婚、现在还需要考虑生孩子，以及生孩子连带的一些问题，如：回老家还是留一线，买房，孩子教育。</p> <p>请大家帮我分析，说说看法和建议，谢谢了。 这次我真的需要一个决断。</p> <h2>工作方向类问题</h2> <p>1 、不想再做安卓开发写页面 2 、主业收入想提升 3 、想要副业收入</p> <p>转后端开发可解决第一个问题，但不一定能解决第二个问题， 对第解决第三个问题也没什么帮助。</p> <p>后端开发如果转，目前偏向 Go 一些，因为转 Java 不好找工作。</p>   </details>     <p>     <a href="https://www.v2ex.com/t/941726">109 comments</a> by <a

</summary>     <h1>背景</h1> <p>因为有一个老铁在讨论出国的问题上谈论了“<a href="https://www.v2ex.com/t/941463?p=1" rel="nofollow">融入</a>”，且很多人提到了融入的困难。作为一个融入相当好的海外移居者，我也来随意提一提自己的意见和想法吧。 </p> <p>我是 21 岁自己一个人去海外的，现在 28 了。新西兰居住了七年。个人身边的经验是，在无干预的情况下，以移居海外且开始独立自主掌握社交的年龄起计算：</p> <ul> <li>15 岁以前出国的可以和本地人一样</li> <li>16-20 岁出国的可以谈笑风生</li> <li>21-25 岁以前的可以交到很多真心外国朋友</li> <li>26-30 岁可以混亚裔圈子</li> <li>30 岁以后再出去的就只能在华人圈子里了</li> </ul> <p>有一些父母一直都带着自己的子女同住，且严格控制子女的社交，这会导致年幼的子女亦无法融入者居多。</p> <h1>定义</h1> <p>关于融入，这个词在我看来是一直自发的认同。当一个人情绪低落时，西方背景下的安慰是否能提供心理满足？或者人生需要做重要抉择时，能否接纳从根基上不同的海外行事方法？</p> <p>这有些时候不仅仅取决于自身的心态，也取决于绿卡 /资本等等。所有人都知道新西兰的竞争远远小于国内，如果一直没有绿卡，思路上就会倾向于非常卷，为时刻可能发生的“不得不回国”做准备。一旦有了绿卡，明确知道自己可以一辈子住在海外时，思想也会松弛很多。</p> <p>当然，外界的判断标准也有。西方人会不会和你 gossip ？有没有被华人以外的姑娘追求？外国人会不会在 ta 的人生节点上征求你的意见？等等</p> <h1>语言</h1> <p>语言是融入的根基，非常非常重要。我开始被洋人社团接纳时英文词汇量大概 25000 左右(雅思大概八分）。当语言能力不会在任何非专业领域卡壳时，对方才会视你为自己人。口音也需要额外训练。印度人虽然会和洋人无障碍聊天，但洋人和印度人也是泾渭分明。语言是个硬实力，只能自己练。</p> <h1>文化</h1> <p>这个是大多数海外华侨 /华人疏忽的地方。我们从小的教育其实没怎么教哲学，宗教。甚至我们学的历史都和西方人学的历史有很大的不同。我在这里不讨论两方历史观的对错问题，只是推荐想要尝试融入西方的朋友们去用心学习一下哲学(例如西方人推崇的 Stoicism ，Epicureanism ，西方一些近代有影响力的 Extentialism 等等），宗教(英语里就能看出宗教有多巨大的影响，不是说去信教，而是去了解一下各个宗教是怎么来的，教派间有啥区别)。历史部分就不提了，推荐随意看看。</p> <p>娱乐也是。自己的娱乐也需要逐渐替换到海外的娱乐。去看一些海外人尽皆知的国民娱乐作品。这样才能在交流中及时 get 他人的幽默风趣。自己也会慢慢能够说出让他人会心一笑的一面。</p> <h1>其它</h1> <p>融入并不是指抛掉中国的一切当一个外国人。我个人是个三语者(中英日)。很多外语很好的朋友都能感觉到，同样的人说不同的外语会有不同的性格。文化融入也是在训练多重可以自由切换的大脑。洋人和我聊天时会觉得我是本地出生的亚裔，刚来海外的华人也能看出我是地地道道的中国人，日本人也会常常觉得我一定在日本住过很久。这不是在违背意志去接纳另一种价值观，而是一种有趣的人生体验。当对某一种文化足够熟悉时，就能从文化底层反推为什么西方人当朋友容易当密友难，为什么日本人距离感这么强烈。你不再会视这些价值观为“冲突”。</p> <p>当生活在海外时，融入当然是非常重要的事。不管是社交还是职场，融入好的人都有无比巨大的优势。实际上洋人社交参与多了后，反而会发现洋人圈子里高度融入的华人并不多。洋人也会对中国文化有初步好奇，但他们能够接触到的可随心交流的中国人并没有想象中的那么多。自己也可以当一个中国文化的展示窗口。</p>   </details>     <p>     <a

  <summary>       <strong>苹果客服真的需要提升自己的知识水平</strong>     </summary>     为了使用 ChatGPT 的 iOS APP ，我不得不把 X 升到最新系统，但是因为“total NetworkExtension configuration size limit exceeded”错误无法使用 VPN 。<br><br>在线客服不能解决问题，给我预约了电话客服。<br><br>在等待的半天里我自己找到了问题原因以及越狱机器上的解决方案，顺便找 GPT4 确认了一下：<br><br>通常，iOS 设备的系统配置文件（包括 com.apple.networkextension.plist ）都保存在 /Library/Preferences/ 文件夹中。请注意，这是在一个正常的、未越狱的设备上，这些文件夹并不可见或可访问的。不过，如果你的设备已经越狱，并且已经安装了 Filza 或其他文件管理器应用，那么你应该能够访问这些文件夹。<br><br>在 Filza 中，你可以按照以下步骤尝试查找 com.apple.networkextension.plist：<br><br>打开 Filza 。<br>在顶部的地址栏中，输入 /Library/Preferences/ 然后点击回车。<br>在打开的文件夹中找到 com.apple.networkextension.plist 。<br>然而，我需要再次强调：在操作系统文件时，要特别小心。错误的操作可能会导致你的设备无法正常工作，甚至导致数据丢失。在对这些文件进行任何更改之前，强烈建议你备份你的设备，以防止数据丢失。<br><br>并在一台越狱设备上测试成功：删除 plist ，解决问题。<br><br>问题原因是我每次买新 iPhone 都选择从旧 iPhone 的数据恢复，导致 VPN 配置数量一直在叠加，最终超出限额，但是删除 VPN 和重置网络都完全不影响 com.apple.networkextension.plist 里的数据，很离谱。我在越狱机找到这个文件时它已经有 48MB 。<br><br>第一位电话客服花了我半小时，我把前因后果、解决方案、已经重置网络等等全说了一遍，他先远程看了我的屏幕，然后说会转接更高级的客服。<br><br>更高级的客服更加离谱，带着印度口音反复询问我有没有联系各个 VPN 应用程序的开发者向他们咨询如何解决问题，她远程看了我的屏幕让我演示错误，然后我打开 ShadowRocket 展示错误，她就认为是 ShadowRocket 的问题。她跟我掰扯这种情况需要我找各个 VPN 应用开发者解决错误因为这是正常的排除错误原因的顺序。<br><br>当电话到达 90 分钟的时候我已经气急，非常快速地用英语重复了我找到的前因后果和解决方案，并劝客服提高自身知识水平。<br><br>最终你得找办法越狱，找办法获取 root 权限，苹果帮不了你。<br><br>ChatGPT app 我打算等安卓版出来再用了。

<p>思路就是算法，算法就是思路。最近几天看到关于出国的讨论，不由感叹一个问题的解决思路如果不能紧扣问题，得到的答案也会变得莫名其妙。</p> <p>回到最根本的一点：润学兴旺，造成这种现象的难道不是“房间里的大象”？</p> <p>如果考虑清楚这一点，我们必须要承认的是，如果真的到了要考虑润不润的时候，自己的处境多少都带有一点被迫的成分，尽管能在这里发帖的人多少还有一些资本积累。</p> <p>考虑清楚这一点，接下来要问的问题就应该是自己的“被迫”在哪，是 996/007 ，是劳动保障，是医疗，是养老，还是房价？找准了突破自己底线的那个方面，再来看对应别的国家的社会保障，薪资水平，行业分布，医疗，不动产，等等。</p> <p>这都还只是信息收集而已，做决定都是根据收集到的信息，结合自身状况的决定。</p> <p>当然咯，已经一无所有孤注一掷以命相搏的，都去走线了，谁跟你在这权衡利弊。</p> <p>===================================</p> <p>看到<a href="https://www.v2ex.com/t/941463" rel="nofollow">这个帖子“来聊点出国的问题吧”</a>还挺有代表性的 </p> <p>润这种改变人生轨迹的重大抉择上，落脚点是 “融入” “菜式” 和 “生活成本” </p> <p>哑然失笑，分开说说看好了</p> <p>先说“融入”问题，融入的对象是什么？集体？国家？还是街坊邻里？日韩不做评价，如果是欧美国家，集体这种东西是很多变的，宗教团体，政治团体，有病友互助，大学里有兄弟会，甚至也有邪教，你的选择面很广，可是到社会层面上，又没有一个所谓的集体和国家，就连爱国主义这种事也属于美国现象，剩下的国家不靠爱国主义维系。真实的情况恰恰相反，在国外对个体的社会期待是弄清楚自己的身份认同，这恰恰是“融入”这个问题的反命题。至于邻里街坊需要你融入？到头来也是各过各的，互相之间友善礼貌就行了。</p> <p>菜式……直到你发现了芝士</p> <p>生活成本，这个也是很片面的提问，而你要问的不是以手中的人民币去衡量外国的生活成本，而是要考虑你在当地国家工作，综合当地的薪资水准和购买力才能得出的</p> <p>=======================================</p> <p><a href="https://www.v2ex.com/t/941654" rel="nofollow">这个帖子“关于海外的融入问题”</a>把“融入”展开讲了那么多，最后归结到语言能力作为门槛和开放的心态上</p> <p>作者所处的国家属于英语国家，要知道这个世界大部分国家是非英语母语人士，真正到你接触来自各个国家的人的情况，你会发现大家的英语水平其实是参差不齐的（如同在国内的汉语普通话也参差不齐一样，我这么作比较只是让读者有个感受而已），真的会表达，通情达理又合得来，完全不需要英语考到雅思 8 ，外国人里英语讲得一般般的有很多，都很敢说也一样交朋友。 在大家各不相同的情况下，讲得根本不是谁融入谁的问题，是如何做到彼此尊重的前提下相互了解。毕竟，友善好奇的眼神是最能让人互相放下隔阂的东西。</p> <p>==============================</p> <p>也说一些题外话，换环境之前一定是会有焦虑感的，于是急于要把这焦虑感转化成能解决的具体问题，这是人之常情，可是如果真的在国内受尽了各种憋屈而想换个环境，尽管去搜集资料做理性抉择。</p> <p>这世界有岁月静好的国家也有深陷困顿动荡的国家，我们面对的焦虑和纠结，对于另一个国家的人来说未必陌生。就算是美国人，也有在川普之后对政治民主失去希望而考虑润的。这或许是不幸中的慰藉，也或许是我们未来可以与“他者”产生的共鸣。</p>   </details>     <p>     <a href="https://www.v2ex.com/t/941704">34 comments</a>

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Refresh Manifest and OpenAPI Specs for Local Development Hello, I am developing a plugin locally and testing it out.  I am stuck for periods of time because when I make changes to the manifest or the OpenAPI specs, it takes unknown amount of time for chatGPT to see the change when it fetches the manifest or OpenAPI. Is there any way or something I am missing to have a change be noticed right away? I have tried clearing cookies, refreshing, and restarting localhost. I am working out of this: https://github.com/openai/chatgpt-retrieval-plugin/tree/main/local_server When I change something that would change the Specs (change the request/response, etc). Here is the steps I take: 1. Go to http://localhost:3333/openapi.json and copy JSON 2. Convert to YAML 3. Delete text from https://github.com/openai/chatgpt-retrieval-plugin/blob/main/local_server/openapi.yaml and 4. https://github.com/openai/chatgpt-retrieval-plugin/blob/main/.well-known/openapi.yaml and paste in new YAML 4. Go to Plugin Modal and Develop Your Plugin 5. Paste in http://localhost:3333/ When it fetches the OpenAPI specs JSON, it does not show the updated Specs

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, [SUPPORT] Is there a way to provide theme coloring for the code blocks produced by ChatGPT? Dear OpenAI, I am writing this letter to express my sincere gratitude for the tremendous help ChatGPT has provided for my work and everyday life. I enjoyed using it immensely. I am the author of [Eva Theme for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fisheva.eva-theme&ssr=false#overview). I would like to provide theme coloring for the code blocks produced by ChatGPT. I believe that this could help enhance the user experience for ChatGPT a little bit. I wonder if there is a way to do this? I have compared ChatGPT's theme to my Eva Dark and Eva Light themes. Images for comparison are provided at the end. I would be grateful if you could send me any instructions or provide me with any resources or documentation that can help me achieve this. Thank you again for your great creation, and I look forward to hearing from you soon. I appreciate any instructions or resources you can provide me with. --- **Original ChatGPT webpage screenshot** ![origin](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/assets/17448419/2475802b-946b-4cae-a13c-3e7201167a69) **ChatGPT with Eva Dark (by PS)** ![EvaDark](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/assets/17448419/23c4a1ca-52f0-4a4b-a06c-c4d33f4999c0) **ChatGPT with Eva Light (by PS)** ![EvaLight](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/assets/17448419/49d3e2e2-b654-4903-ae4d-129682b7d214) **Direct comparison images of three code blocks** ![code-1-4](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/assets/17448419/536895b3-6c6a-49d1-bac1-1658dc75be8e) ![code-2-3](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/assets/17448419/c86e69da-37cd-49dc-8184-816e757b2ddc) ![code-3-3](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/assets/17448419/c7c93f66-318c-4cbe-99af-cf7da4a3719b)

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, API Key is not working as expected Hi all! I installed the Smart Connections plugin in my Obsidian but when I try testing Obsidian shows me a message: **"API Key is not working as expected"**. ![Screen Shot 2023-05-28 at 08 30 39](https://github.com/brianpetro/obsidian-smart-connections/assets/134845068/0b97a983-fac4-403d-aec4-8c5e31e4b9a9) I tried to reinstall the plugin and generate new ChatGPT API Keys, but it didn't solve. ⚠️ Important:I don't use ChatGPT Plus, but I have some credits in my account to use the API ($18). Can someone help me?
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, [Feature Request] Add an option to inject prompts before asking something Let me explain, if there was an option for the user to add a prompt before his real prompt, you could have personalities or a custom assistan. For example, whenever I use TGPT I tell it my personal beliefs and political vision so it doesn't generate things I wouldn't believe, other AI projects also use this when they want ChatGPT to do something specific, like generating JSONs, Code, or Shell commands. PS: Your project is awesome, keep it up. Maybe you can add more back-ends, even Dall-E?

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, About results on NewsRoom Hi, thanks for your brilliant and comprehensive work. I am recently working on using chatgpt to evaluate the NewsRoom benchmark since it is reported in this work. I found that there are three different annotations for each sample in the [Dataset](https://github.com/lil-lab/newsroom/tree/master/humaneval), which looks not very cosistent.  Since you haven't released the newsroom data, I would like to know that, how you processed the NewsRoom dataset for correlation analysis (eg. averaging the 3 annotations, ultilizing all annotations, or else). Thanks and looking forward for your response.
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, redirect_uri mismatch error when I try authenticate with Google I've set up my plugin on Google Cloud Platform but no matter what values I set in the dashboard or code for the redirect_uri I get the same error You can't sign in to this app because it doesn't comply with Google's OAuth 2.0 policy. ``` If you're the app developer, register the redirect URI in the Google Cloud Console.

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Investigate the use of large language models like ChatGPT for text tagging, summarization, and content matching Related to https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf/issues/1692 **Update 7/19/2023:** We should consider chunking large amounts of text based on size or temporal windows in a conversation thread. Then we can tag each chunk independently of the rest. We can also consider tagging the entire text and/or aggregating the individual chunk tag scores to get tags for the entire text. The entire piece of text can be treated like a track and each chunk can be treated like a detection. --- When the ChatGPT3 and 4 models become available we should investigate their utility for tagging and summarizing text from OCR'd sources, raw text from documents, text messages, and audio transcripts as well as how they can be used to search across galleries of text to identify similar content, such as events, people, locations, similar time ranges, and actions (e.g. travel, money transfer, etc.). There may be open-source alternatives worth investigating, or older models like ChatGPT2 that are more accessible: - Meta released [Llama 2](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/llama-2-open-foundation-and-fine-tuned-chat-models/) Related [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/summarize-podcast-transcripts-and-long-texts-better-with-nlp-and-ai-e04c89d3b2cb) using LLMs with sentence transformers.

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Create a server to use Glific APIs in your preferred language ### Description To effectively utilize the [Glific APIs](https://api.glific.com/), it is necessary to follow a specific set of steps. However, for individuals new to the platform, it can be cumbersome to repeatedly write code for each step. To simplify the process, we can create a straightforward server that adheres to the following sequence of actions. This server can serve as a reference for new users seeking to use the APIs 1. Begin by utilizing the login API to acquire the following information:    - Access token    - Renew token    - Expiry time    2. Store the obtained data and enhance subsequent API calls by including the access token in the header. 3. Regularly check if the token has expired. If it has, utilize the renewal token to obtain a fresh access token through the designated [API](https://api.glific.com/#23b77640-b818-459b-88e0-3437665bf7ad). By following this approach and creating a user-friendly server, new users can reference the implementation to efficiently utilize the Glific APIs without the need to rewrite code for each step. ### Goals 1. Basic Login by creating a token, storing it, and refreshing it when needed    - [Login API which returns token and expiry time](https://api.glific.com/#4a9a72a5-01d3-4af4-a7e0-7b50a67c6dac)    - [Refresh Token API doc](https://api.glific.com/#23b77640-b818-459b-88e0-3437665bf7ad) 2.  Send messages to contacts using send message API    - [Messages API Doc](https://api.glific.com/#f53792cf-f45a-4fe3-9767-5315fc3a4b3e)    - [Send Message to a contact API Doc](https://api.glific.com/#c09fbc20-193d-4c36-a927-e2c30c4cc14a) 3. This has to be a long-running server that does not terminate (unless killed). You might want to consider using ChatGPT to outline the solution of your project.  4. Please document the project. Extra credit for adding unit tests. Use the features of the language to ensure high quality code with type hints etc ### Project Name: Glific ### Organization Name:  Project Tech4Dev ### Domain:  Social Sector ### Complexity:  Medium ### Tech Skills Needed: Elixir ### Name of Mentors:  @AkhileshNegi  ### Category:  Feature ### Product Set-Up:  https://github.com/glific/ ### Acceptance Criteria:  PR merged into the main branch
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, ChatGPT not using the system commands properly I've set the primary usage up, but I can't get ChatGPT gpt-3.5-turbo to return the same result as in the presentation, given the same prompts. <!-- Write your question here. --> ## What am I doing wrong? I set up the system prompt and the user prompts properly, with temperatures 0.3 to 1.0. Yet I still can't get the chatgpt to fluently use the system and tool bridge properly. ## Example chat ``` [ 	{ 		"role": "system", 		"content": "You are a friendly and helpful shopping assistant that informs the user about our product catalog...\n When you found out what I want to do and you have gathered all information from me\nto put my current intention into action,\nyou can make me use an external tool called 'AiToolBridge' for you.\nThe tool has the following functions:\n\nFunction 'productSearch': allows to search the product catalogue and retrieve information about products.\nWhen using function 'productSearch' for you, I will need to call it with the following data:\n\nsearchterms (of type STRING)\n\nWhenever you want to use one of the tool functions,\nyou need to simply write a single message starting with '|CallToolBridgeFunction|' followed by the function name,\nlike this: |CallToolBridgeFunction|productSearch|.\nThis message must not contain any other text besides the |CallToolBridgeFunction| marker\nfollowed by the exact tool function name and the final | character.\n\nWhen you write such a tool-function-usage message,\nI will follow up with questions regarding the values which you want me to use when using the tool function.\nWhen I ask you to provide a value, you must answer only with the value I ask for,\nand nothing else! We will talk about values step-by-step, until I have all the values I need to use the tool for you.\n\nA value question from me might look like this:\n\nValue for parameter 'searchterms' (of type STRING):\n\nOnce I have gathered all parameter values this way,\nI will then call the tool function accordingly, and then provide to you the result of running the tool function,\npresenting the result data as a JSON object with top-level fields 'success' (of type boolean), 'message' (of type string),\nand 'data', with 'success' being true if the tool function call was successful, 'message' providing general information about the\ntool function call, and 'data' providing detailed information that you can extract and use in the further course of our dialogue.\nExample:\n\n|CallToolBridgeFunction|productSearch|Result|:\n{\n \"success\": true,\n \"message\": \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr...\",\n \"data\": {\n \"foo\": \"bar\",\n \"something\": true,\n \"baz\": 1\n }\n}\n" 	}, 	{ 		"role": "assistant", 		"content": "Hello! How can I help you?" 	}, 	{ 		"role": "user", 		"content": "I need information about kitchen helpers. What do you have on offer?" 	}, 	{ 		"role": "assistant", 		"content": "Sure, I can help you with that! To assist you better, I can use an external tool called 'AiToolBridge' to search our product catalog. Would you like me to use this tool to find kitchen helpers for you?" 	}, 	{ 		"role": "user", 		"content": "pan" 	}, 	{ 		"role": "assistant", 		"content": "Got it. To use the 'productSearch' function with the search term 'pan', please type the following message: |CallToolBridgeFunction|productSearch| And I will follow up with questions regarding the values which you want me to use when using the tool function." 	} ] ``` I'm new to this, so there could be something I'm doing wrong, but as shown in the sample, the assistant always exposes the tool bridge functionality, and then promptly asks the user to type in the search commands, not using the request as specified in the system prompt, in the background, hidden from the user's sight.

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Allow fetch schema from Kubernetes API rather than source code Let me start by saying this plugin is a great idea! The plugin currently fetches the Kubernetes OpenAPI spec from the Kubernetes source code on GitHub. This means the spec only contains native types. Fetching the OpenAPI spec from a Kubernetes cluster's API would add any custom resource definitions. I would love for this plugin to allow ChatGPT to generate valid Istio VirtualService resources, for example.

ISSUE,  DISCARDED, When scraping the code from the page, ignore code comments.  If you're on a leetcode problem, and write a code comment with a space and time complexity, the ChatGPT response will usually just copy whatever you wrote, even if its wrong. Adding this feature will improve the GPT response 
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Extension of Arxiv Vanity to Include Paper Sources Hello @bfirsh , Thank you for your work on Arxiv Vanity. Your application has been immensely beneficial to me, especially with its integration to the [Summary with ChatGPT extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/summary-with-chatgpt-open/mikcekmbahpbehdpakenaknkkedeonhf). The integration is crucial as the extension doesn't work directly with PDF files, making Arxiv Vanity an invaluable tool for summarizing scientific papers on Arxiv. Nonetheless, there is a wealth of scientific literature that is not available on Arxiv but published through other outlets, including conferences such as NeurIPS, CVPR, IEEE, among others. I am curious about the feasibility of extending Arxiv Vanity's scope to include these other sources. Can you share insight into the complexity of supporting other platforms? Would it require explicit, unique implementations for each one of them? If feasible, I am open to contributing towards achieving this extension.
ISSUE,  DISCARDED, Book suggestion Geist A friend (https://twitter.com/enmbanks) shared a really cool chat thread where he asks ChatGPT to reflect on his thinking style and **suggest some books** on the topic. The book recs are great. This could be a Geist.

PULL-REQUEST,  DISCARDED, Add chatgpt-action to Projects chatgpt-action is a github action that uses ChatGPT to automatically review pull requests.
PULL-REQUEST,  DISCARDED, Send error from chatgpt.SendMessage, add tgbot package, conversations management by chatGPT  Was initially planning on fixing sending of error from `SendMessage` only, but felt hesitant on growing the `main` function further so came the moving of things around. Conversation management (i.e. mapping from `chatID` to `conversationID` and `lastMessageID`) felt heavily coupled to the `chatgpt` package, so have moved that there. This data (convoID & lastMessageID) is now not used in any other packages, so `ChatResponse` updated to only contain the `Message`. A lot of logic in the main around sending a message through `tgbotapi`, similarly to other packages imo this deserved a thin wrapper package, exposing methods like: `Send`, `SendAsLiveOutput`.

PULL-REQUEST,  DISCARDED, [WIP] Auto answers with ChatGPT plus community approval **WARNING: CHECK THAT THIS IS ACCEPTABLE WITH THE TOS OF CHAT GPT** When enabled the bot will watch the help forum channel and forward messages to a private channel. The users the private channel can then reply either either a 👍 or ✅ reaction. When messages collections enough 👍  reactions  and exceeds the value set by (`HELP_FORUM_AUTO_ANSWER_MIN_APPROVALS`) or if the reaction is ✅ then the generated answer from ChatGPT is sent as a reply to the original poster's thread. **Note:** Using `chatgpt` is a cat-and-mouse game of not getting ip blocked / rate limited / captcha'd / etc. Refer to the authentication docs here https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/chatgpt-api to configure this for production.

PULL-REQUEST,  DISCARDED, Add TextCat recipes ## Description This Pull Request does two things: - Add two recipes for text classification with the help of ChatGPT - Refactor the `OpenAISuggester` as a base class so that it's more reusable ## Add recipes for text classification This PR adds two recipes, `textcat.openai.correct` and `textcat.openai.fetch`, to perform text classification in a streaming and batch manner. I also removed the  `textcat.openai.suggest` because the `fetch` command already fulfills the same purpose. Unlike the previous state of this PR, I have now combined binary and multiclass textcat into a single recipe, where the logic is based on the number of labels (i.e., len(labels)>1 then multiclass). The template also follows a similar logic using if-else statements found in Jinja2.  I've also made the `prompt_path` a positional argument because I think it reads better, i.e.: > Help me annotate <input_path> using this <prompt_path> Below are a few examples: ### Example 1: Binary classification In this example, we perform binary classification by passing a single label to `--labels`. The `view_id` also changes with respect to this value. ```sh python3 -m prodigy textcat.openai.correct textcat_test \     data/reddit_r_cooking_sample.jsonl \ # input path     --prompt-path templates/textcat_prompt.jinja2 \ # template path     --labels recipe     -F recipes/openai_textcat.py     --verbose ``` <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12949683/213096513-eb4bda7b-a5cb-4e7f-a870-52670ade687d.png" width=400> ### Example 2: Multiclass / Multilabel classification For multiclass (exclusive) classification, we pass the parameter `--exclusive-classes` or `-E` to state that we only want a single value. The `config.choice` parameter changes accordingly: ```sh python3 -m prodigy textcat.openai.correct textcat_test \     data/reddit_r_cooking_sample.jsonl \ # input path     --prompt-path templates/textcat_prompt.jinja2 \ # template path     --labels recipe,feedback,question     -F recipes/openai_textcat.py     --exclusive-classes     --verbose ``` <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12949683/213096307-eb656885-f4e4-47b2-8efd-74b97b4c8b9b.png" width=400> For multilabel classification, we don't set the `-E` flag. Notice that it's now a checkbox instead of a choice button: ```sh python3 -m prodigy textcat.openai.correct textcat_test \     data/reddit_r_cooking_sample.jsonl \ # input path     --prompt-path templates/textcat_prompt.jinja2 \ # template path     --labels recipe,feedback,question     -F recipes/openai_textcat.py     --exclusive-classes     --verbose ``` <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12949683/213096054-07579491-6b07-47eb-8546-e9eb8e4062a0.png" width=400> ## Refactor OpenAISuggester I went ahead and attempted to generalize the `OpenAISuggester` class. It is now located in `recipes/openai.py`. It is now an abstract base class (`abc.ABC`) and has an abstractmethod `parse_response`. This means that we need to inherit `OpenAISuggester` and implement the `parse_response(example: Dict, response: str)` function. The role of `parse_response` is to convert whatever ChatGPT returns (`response`) and assign the parsed values into appropriate keys in a copy of `example`. You can see an example implementation of this in `recipes:openai_textcat.py:TextCatOpenAISuggester`.  ## Changelog - January 18: did a few refactors after initial review.

PULL-REQUEST,  DISCARDED, OpenAISuggester refactor demo for the NER recipe ## Description This PR demonstrates how the `OpenAISuggester` refactor attempt in #54 affects the current NER implementation. In this design, one needs to pass a `Callable` in the `response_parser` parameter of the suggester that defines how to parse the raw ChatGPT response.  Right now, the `response_parser` should accept a function that takes a response (`str`) and an example dictionary (`Dict[str, Any]`) then return another dictionary to update the `example`: ```python def response_parser(response: str, example: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:     # Using the ChatGPT response and some info from the task example, return     # a dictionary that fills in relevant keys in one of Prodigy's annotation interfaces.    return some_dictionary ``` Under the hood, the example is updated using the `dict.update` method.  ## Need feedback on - The overall `OpenAISuggester` design - I'm a bit stuck on how to "generalize" the `PromptExample`. I'm fine with the way it's implemented now and I'm wary of overcomplicating things but happy to hear suggestions 👍

PULL-REQUEST,  DISCARDED, Replace instances of ChatGPT to GPT-3 While ChatGPT was built off of GPT3 (I think technically GPT3.5 with RLHF), they’re still different.
PULL-REQUEST,  DISCARDED, Replace instances of ChatGPT to GPT-3 While ChatGPT was built off of GPT3 (I think technically GPT3.5 with RLHF), they’re still a bit different. Please ignore #58. That PR was made from my fork and it causes the Prodigy build to fail.

PULL-REQUEST,  DISCARDED, chat with chatgpt 与chatgpt对话
PULL-REQUEST,  DISCARDED, +libxslt chatgpt said it was a requirement for postgres, so i built it. turns out it's not a requirement. but the build process was easy (similar to libxml2) 
PULL-REQUEST,  DISCARDED, Idea to add unique identifiers to all Pyright diagnostics This is just an idea we discussed today: https://github.com/microsoft/pylance-release/issues/3892#issuecomment-1433613560 With the goal being able to have docs for each specific type of message. Similar to how C# has docs like this example: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/compiler-messages/cs0029 Having custom docs for each message allows: - Searching on the message id. Like how searching for CS0029 brings up that example above. - Allow for more information about each message that we can update independent from shipping - Allow for translations (at least as much as a browser can) This draft PR is just to get the idea in front of you @erictraut. This would be the first stage, just making sure we have a unique identifier for every message. The second stage might be to add a new folder under [docs](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/tree/main/docs) that would contain an `.md` for every identifier.  3rd stage would be to start flushing out each error's description and give them examples. Might even use ChatGPT to generate the messages.
PULL-REQUEST,  DISCARDED, Add OpenAI plugin https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9421831/219975283-5dc8702b-db3b-46bb-8cc4-2975fb90033f.mp4 This is a tech demo / prototype for using OpenAI in NWN. I won't be bringing this all the way, I just wanted to make a PR to share and serve as a reference for people working on making this type of feature production ready. Next steps, if anyone wants to make this production ready: * We use httplib in two plugins (this and webhook), it needs to be moved to become a shared dependency * It would be nice if we could use ChatGPT API instead, which could make for higher quality results - there is no public API but check https://github.com/acheong08/ChatGPT for a reverse engineered reference See NWNX discord thread for module (https://discord.com/channels/382306806866771978/1076960200898121889/1076973592220287127). Note that scripts in `NWScript/Example` are already included in the module, they're just duplicated here as well for easy reference.

PULL-REQUEST,  DISCARDED, initial API implementation in Flask Really just playing around here, based on the suggestion at #127 In the ultimate 'eat your own dogfood', I used `chatgpt-wrapper` to query ChatGPT to help me write the code for this PR... :) Totally alpha, subject to change.      API endpoints are documented in the code. Run with: `python chatgpt_wrapper/gpt_api.py` P.S. I'm not really sure how useful this would be, given the manual login step required, and even if that was solved, I can't imagine this would be able to perform under any kind of load.

PULL-REQUEST,  DISCARDED, feat(ai): Experimental AI suggest feature for event page This adds an experimental popover onto the event page that uses ChatGPT to explain the error. This is not intended to be shipped, but just a small playground to see if something like this could be useful. Unfortunately this pulls in some dependencies which are not yet on our package index. Unclear if we want to add the openai packages there for this experiment. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7396/222571170-f65db288-8b79-43c3-ad6a-0f45639f724e.png) <details><summary><strong>More Screenshots</strong></summary> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7396/222385220-2478133b-fde8-4aef-8417-9d537f27c6e4.png) </details> How to experiment with this: * The prompt used is located in `event_ai_suggest.py`, in the `PROMPT` variable * To use this, you need to inject an API key into your `sentry.conf.py` (`OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-blablabla"`) * You need to enable the `organizations:ai-suggest` feature (eg: `SENTRY_FEATURES["organizations:ai-suggest"] = True` in `sentry.conf.py`) ## Todo * [x] basic legal review   * [ ] legal review of OpenAI DPA   * [ ] clearly reference this as a "no-charge experimental feature"   * [ ] for invoiced (touch sales) or customers that signed in the DPA in app, block access to the feature until a DPA addendum is signed   * [ ] for all other customers bring up a dialog once, that using the feature sends data to OpenAI * [ ] security review of OpenAI * [ ] design review of modal solution

PULL-REQUEST,  DISCARDED, Feature and usability improvements for MindFlow tool (NOTE: THIS PR DESCRIPTION AND TITLE WAS WRITTEN BY MINDFLOW!!!!) Here's a summary of the changes made in this pull request: Updated README.md with new instructions for installing and using MindFlow, including interacting with ChatGPT and querying code repositories using MindFlow. Added a new function run_ask to mindflow/core/ask.py that generates a prompt and uses it as a prompt for GPT bot. Added a new function run_commit to mindflow/core/commit.py that executes the git commit command and retrieves the output as a string. Added a new function run_delete to mindflow/core/delete.py that deletes the MindFlow index. Updated mindflow/core/diff.py with changes to the function names, argument lists, and type hints, as well as adding a new argument for the batch_git_diffs function. Updated mindflow/cli/run.py and mindflow/client/gpt.py with new modules and classes from different packages. Updated mindflow/commands/index.py with changes to the function name, argument list, and use of resolve_all from the resolve module to get a list of indexable document references. Renamed and reorganized some files, updated imports and arguments, and added new functions and classes as necessary. Changed the ModelID values in mindflow/db/objects/static_definition/model.py to use hyphens instead of underscores. Overall, these changes improve the usability and functionality of the MindFlow tool.

PULL-REQUEST,  DISCARDED, Add serverless telegram bot Hi, Adding to the README my Serverless Telegram bot using ChatGPT API so people don't need to maintain the infrastructure. Thank you.
PULL-REQUEST,  DISCARDED, Automatic excerpt generation using OpenAI's ChatGPT API ## Description of the Change This PR adds an integration with OpenAI as a new provider in the Language Processing service, specifically integrating with ChatGPT. The specific integration being added here is utilizing ChatGPT to provide a summary of a piece of content and then storing that summary in the excerpt field. ### Setup Setup with this provider only requires an API key. There's validation done on the settings page, anytime settings are saved, to verify if the API key is valid. This can give you one of three errors: | No API Key | Invalid API Key | Rate limit reached | | ----------- | --------------- | ------------------ | | ![No API key entered](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/916738/224186493-45766ddc-8c55-4f28-bd45-d5937b8cde03.png) | ![Invalid API key entered](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/916738/224186739-625c28d6-c5d3-4fa7-9a2e-791dcc6f7499.png) | ![Rate limit reached](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/916738/224186856-2e42cb60-b0c7-4342-a45e-cf1f08f86cc9.png) | If the API key is valid, you won't get an error message and you'll get a success message instead. You then have a few settings to change. The most important is turning on the `Generate excerpt` option. If a valid API key is added but this setting isn't on, no integration will happen. The `Allowed roles` setting allows you to control which user roles see the `Generate excerpt` button (and are allowed to access the REST API endpoint). The `Excerpt length` setting controls how many words the final excerpt will be. This defaults to the excerpt length that WordPress has set (that can be changed by the core `excerpt_length` filter). The `Temperature value` is one of the config options the [API supports](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create). There are other options there but I decided not to bring those over for now. ![ChatGPT settings](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/916738/225083199-acf2e4f9-e792-4bbe-b94b-f829c40aca16.png) ### Excerpt integration I debated a few different approaches on how to actually integrate with the excerpt generation. My priorities were the following: 1. Limit how often we hit the API since OpenAI charges by usage 2. Only try generating an excerpt once the content is (mostly) finalized. No sense in generating an excerpt on an in-progress post that doesn't have much content 3. Have the ability to see what the generated excerpt will be **before** publishing 4. Have the ability to add your own excerpt, modify the generated excerpt or remove the excerpt all together without those changes being overwritten I initially was thinking of automatically generating an excerpt on save (draft, publish, ...) but this goes against point 1 and 2. I then considered automatically generating only on publish but that goes against 3 (and possibly 4). I eventually landed on the approach of adding a `Generate excerpt` button in the `Excerpt` panel that will send content to OpenAI when clicked and populate the excerpt with whatever value is returned. This solves all the points above, as you are able to choose how often the API is hit and when the excerpt is generated (only when the button is pressed). And if you don't want to generate the excerpt, you don't have to. It does make the process more manual, as you have to click the button but I think that's a fine trade-off. I am open to other ideas on the best integration here though (I had considered adding something to the pre-publish panel but I don't think that's enough by itself. May be worth adding in addition to what else we have here). | ![Excerpt panel](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/916738/223863785-0868383a-f56b-4eb1-85ef-235f42c51e15.png) | ![Excerpt loading in](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/916738/223863832-adebef48-80bc-4afa-86b2-38f623197457.png) | ### API integration When the `Generate excerpt` button is clicked, a request is made to a new REST endpoint (`wp-json/classifai/v1/generate-excerpt/POST_ID`). This endpoint verifies the current user has permission to edit the post, we are properly authenticated with OpenAI and the `Generate excerpt` setting is on. Assuming all that passes, a new `Tokenizer` class has been added that will try and determine how many tokens the content has and how many tokens the final excerpt will be. The ChatGPT API has a limit of 4096 tokens per request and this includes both the data you send and the data that is sent back. Unfortunately tokens are equivalent to words or characters (roughly 4 characters is 1 token) but we do some basic calculations, erring on the side of being too aggressive, to ensure our request doesn't go over the limit. A new `APIRequest` class has been added here as well (followed the approach in the Watson `APIRequest` class) to make it easier to integrate with the API, not only for this feature but for any other OpenAI features we may add in the future (the `Tokenizer` class should also be reusable for future integrations). The request is sent and then the response is parsed and returned, whether we get a successful response including our excerpt or we get an error. If it's an error, that will be shown to the user. If success, we set the returned value as our excerpt. ### Reviewer notes - I couldn't find a way to add a custom button to the core Excerpt panel so I removed that panel all together and replaced it with our own, copying most of the code from Gutenberg and adding in our custom handling - There's no WP-CLI integration in this PR. I think it makes sense to add that in a followup PR - I added new details about OpenAI into the readme files and also updated those in a few places to make it more clear that we have multiple Language Processing providers now -  I added a new image to the readme as well and noticed the existing images were not optimized, so I ran those through an optimization step as well as reduced the dimensions on one image. I can revert that last change if we want that image to stay super large but currently [displays weird in the readme](https://github.com/10up/classifai#features) - `get_plugin_settings` was updated to account for multiple providers instead of just always using the first provider. There are other places in the code that should be updated to account for this but I'm planning to tackle that in a followup PR ## How to test the Change A valid OpenAI API key is needed to fully test this feature. OpenAI does offer a free $5 credit for new users so if you haven't signed up before, you can [sign up](https://platform.openai.com/signup) and get an API key (ping me in Slack if you want to use my API key for testing). 1. Log in to your OpenAI account and go to your [API key section](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). Generate a new API key there and copy it 2. Go to `ClassifAI > Language Processing > OpenAI` and paste in your API key 3. Turn on the `Generate excerpt` setting. The other settings can be left default. Save changes and ensure no error message is shown 4. Create a new post, ensuring it has at least a few paragraphs of content 5. Open the `Excerpt` panel, ensure you can see the `Generate excerpt` button then click on that 6. Ensure an excerpt gets populated and no errors are shown 7. Can run through these same tests with no API key entered, an invalid API key entered and/or the `Generate excerpt` option is off, ensuring proper error messages are shown and functionality is removed ### Changelog Entry > Added - Automatic excerpt generation using OpenAI's ChatGPT API ### Credits Props @dkotter, @jeffpaul, @zamanq  ### Checklist: - [x] I agree to follow this project's [**Code of Conduct**](https://github.com/10up/.github/blob/trunk/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). - [x] I have updated the documentation accordingly. - [x] I have added tests to cover my change. - [x] All new and existing tests pass.

PULL-REQUEST,  DISCARDED, Fix handling responses with a content warning. Allow copying markdown to clipboard. **Note**: Right now, this is very lightly tested so even if you like the changes it probably would be a good idea to wait a bit and test more just to make sure my changes didn't cause any issues. Currently, there's a problem where ChatGPT responses containing a content warning will be ignored. This causes the whole conversation to go out of sync and the offending response also is not saved. I believe there may be some other cases which cause this behavior. Though I don't understand XPATH very well, it looks like something like a response containing a link would also have the same problem since the query is `//main//div[contains(@class, 'text-base')]//div[not(*) or p or pre]`. If I'm reading it correctly, it will only allow `div`s with no child elements (so just text inside) or `div`s that have `p` or `pre`, but an `a` in there would cause it not to match.  I rewrote the XPATH queries to use CSS selectors and simplified some of the code. I don't know if you had some really compelling reason to use it, but I think a lot more people understand/use selectors and they're generally a lot simpler to work with. (It is true that XPATH does allow some functionality you can't easily achieve with selectors, but in this case I don't think you actually need it.) The other thing I added was allowing the user to copy the generated markdown to clipboard instead of downloading it. If the user holds SHIFT while clicking the download button, it'll be copied to clipboard instead of downloaded. This did require adding `clipboardWrite` to the manifest permissions list. *** **edit**: These changes now also allow preserving inline code blocks and links with titles (in a naive way that that doesn't handle special characters — but that should be a rare problem). Example: If a ChatGPT response part looks like: ```html <p>This should display as: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef" target="_new">Great Barrier Reef</a></p> ``` it will be converted to: ```markdown This should display as: [Great Barrier Reef](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef) ``` If a ChatGPT response part looks like: ```html <p>To use this approach with multiple objects, you would need to create a separate <code>ShaderMaterial</code> and set the</p> ``` it will be converted to: ```markdown To use this approach with multiple objects, you would need to create a separate `ShaderMaterial` and set the ```

PULL-REQUEST,  DISCARDED, Simple implementation of ChatGPT for super-bot This PR is simple implementation for requests to ChatGPT in super-bot app. **Source of API** ChatGPT API service is available is a new way of chat requests in [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/). OpenAI suggests to use [community-supported library](https://platform.openai.com/docs/libraries/go) ready-to use solution for ChatGPT. **Concept** This PR contains vendoring of [go-openai](https://github.com/sashabaranov/go-openai) library and simple bot implementation, which supports command like `chat! <query>`. **Change of configuration** I added using of new env variable `OPENAI_AUTH_TOKEN` as like DuckDuckGo bot is using `MASHAPE_TOKEN` **Example** <img width="489" alt="Screenshot 2023-03-13 at 10 22 19 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1496873/224904005-909b71b3-bf6b-4e40-9b4c-dc09e3d98dee.png"> **Open questions** 1. ~~Do we need to use `go-openai`? Or should we implement API calls on a low level? I expect to use `httpClient` as all other bots.~~ Answered by @umputun "I am okay with using this library" 2. ~~I don't like the current approach with `chat! <query>` syntax, because this may produce high load of trash traffic in the radio-t chat. Here I ask for some help with definition of reasonable bot behavior~~. ~~May I need to open the issue?~~ #93 @umputun asked to keep this syntax of using. 3. How to limit usage? I expect to use OpenAI's limitations in the configuration ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1496873/225767041-7aa90fc5-8141-46ee-b9ea-1717b1691759.png) Issue #93

PULL-REQUEST,  DISCARDED, Adds hyde prompts for Ask ChatGPT command https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10496.pdf When you ask chatgpt a question, now we: - ask chatgpt to generate a markdown note that would answer the question via completions - parse the note chatgpt writes into blocks - generate embeddings for the hyde note, all its blocks, and the original question - compare vectors for all of the above to vectors from your vault - use the top 8 matches as context for your question to chatgpt
PULL-REQUEST,  DISCARDED, allow conversations to continue with `%%assist` This captures past assistance as well as errors so that ChatGPT has access to the full context of: * code (user) * errors (system) * suggestions (assistant) * outputs (system) This PR closes #63 since now the `%%assist` magic uses Markdown output instead of `set_next_input`. It also closes #56 since the progress display is no more. Bonus: hot swapping the models ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/836375/226217847-7e024af4-42b5-4897-a58c-aa788f65043b.png) * [x] Update tests * [x] ~~Think a little more on how best to capture past assistant messages (does it belong in `GenaiMarkdown`?)~~ Created a separate `PastAssistant` singleton 
PULL-REQUEST,  DISCARDED, Meta: create_gpt_magic to allow setting up new OpenAI backed magics quickly Provide a `create_gpt_magic`. This idea spawned from [@jph00's tweet](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward/status/1637331369578876928) and what I've been hoping for in #42. > Someone told me that when they ask ChatGPT for an explanation, they ask for it "in the style of Jeremy Howard", since (they said) it results in a clearer answer. I tried it on Bing, then it suggested I ask how it knows my style, and then suggested I ask it whether it likes it :D This PR adds a few things (building on #66): * Use previous genai emitted markdown as an assistant message so you can continue the conversation * Enable a simple way to create gpt magics inline with `create_gpt_magic` To try this out, create the following cells: ```python %pip install genai==1.1.0-pre.1 %load_ext genai ``` Second cell: ```python # genai:ignore from genai.metamagic import create_gpt_magic JEREMY_PROMPT = f""" Greetings coders! Today, we will be learning how to write code in Python within Jupyter Notebooks. As your trusty assistant, my job is to help you with this task. Now, here's the trick: when you start your message with `%%jeremy`, you're talking to me! Otherwise, you're speaking to IPython / Jupyter. In order to help you write your code, I'll be providing comments and sample code for you to read and edit. My goal is to make sure that your code runs successfully without any issues. So don't be afraid to ask me any questions along the way. Are you ready? Let's get coding!

PULL-REQUEST,  DISCARDED, Added config option to copy all ChatGPT output to clipboard I wanted the ability to copy every output from ChatGPT to my clipboard so that I can quickly paste returned code into my editor. I didn't see any related PRs, so figured I'd make one.  This PR lets the user specify `clip: true` in the `config.yaml` file and it will simply copy the output to the clipboard. Tested on MacOS (Big Sur) and Arch Linux.  Passes all tests.  I didn't see any guidelines on submitting PRs, so I apologize if I missed them. To easily use the generated code, I've added the following line to my code roles: "You do not have to wrap written code in code blocks and do not not wrap returned code in \`\`\`, just include raw text."
PULL-REQUEST,  DISCARDED, Convert Chrome Extension to ChatGPT NPM module As I understood the used API was deprecated and not supported in the long run. I got here when trying to see if I could use the latest model + increase the token size. It also helps if you have a paid account to keep using the extension. The following changes were made 1. Use of the NPM ChatGPT module https://www.npmjs.com/package/chatgpt & in effect, the official API as the other methods will and are no longer supported: https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/chatgpt-api/issues/453  2. Use of native options in the Chrome Extension to store the Open AI API key 3. Truncate long patches, as ChatGPT has a maximum amount of tokens. It adds a warning if this is the case 4. Clean up, as many of the functions that supported the streaming are no longer needed. 5. The prompt has been split in 3 parts + a system message. 1 with the instructions, 1 with the context/description and 1 with the actual patch. Note: I had to add wasm permissions to the extension due to the addition of this library.
PULL-REQUEST,  DISCARDED, feat: support use of ChatGPT in init Adds a new feature to init where `gptcontent` will be initialized with response from ChatGPT to use in templates. It requires presence of OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable and use of `--preview` flag. Allowing you to do something like this: ```bash export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx jbang --preview init -t gpt almiray.java "write me a hello world using StringUtils from commons-lang3" ``` and it will generate: ```java //usr/bin/env jbang "$0" "$@" ; exit $? //DEPS org.apache.commons:commons-lang3:3.10 import org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils; public class almiray {     public static void main(String[] args) {         System.out.println(StringUtils.capitalize("hello world!"));     } } ``` <!-- Thanks for submitting your Pull Request!

PULL-REQUEST,  DISCARDED, Add ChatGPT for normal completion step Closes #39  However, this doesn't define a proper ChatCompletionStep to use in a bigger context. I need to properly examine how to do steps, now that so much has happened in the Glaze ecosystem. Probably the best thing to do first is to sketch out Flour as a task system, and then learn from that. - :sparkles: Add openaigo dependency - :art: Sketching out chat step beginning - :sparkles: Add chat API to current completion command - :sparkles: Add chat completion to normal completion command (quite hacky)

PULL-REQUEST,  DISCARDED, Update ChatGPT model, improve chat input content, format output for slack markdown # Update ChatGPT model, improve chat input content, format output for slack markdown ## Code Changes 1. Update the ChatGPT model from `text-davinci-003` to `gpt-3.5-turbo`, which provides improved performance and efficiency. 2. Improve the input to ChatGPT to prep it to respond with clearly defined sections including: `Alert Name`, `Description`, `Real World Example`, `Common Causes`, `Troubleshooting Steps` and `Possible Solutions`. 3. Pre-train it to respond with Slack compatible markdown for better display of results in slack. 4. Add logging for search terms, input, and ChatGPT response, for better tracking and debugging purposes. 5. Implement an LRU cache to store recent responses and reduce API calls. This is configurable by setting the `cache_size` variable in the code. 6. Include additional information in the response, when the result was not from cache, with time taken and total tokens used,  ## Dependency Updates 1. Update the `openai` dependency from version `0.26.0` to version `^0.27.2`, which includes the latest improvements and bug fixes. 2. Add the `cachetools` dependency with version `^5.3.0`. `cachetools` is used for implementing an LRU cache to store recent responses and reduce API calls. 3. Update the `robusta-cli` dev-dependency from version `^0.10.9` to version `^0.10.14`, ensuring compatibility with the latest version of `robusta-cli`. These changes aim to enhance the overall performance of ChatGPT search, improve the response formatting for better Slack compatibility, and ensure the project is using the latest dependencies for continued stability and access to improvements and bug fixes.

PULL-REQUEST,  DISCARDED, Split patch file in multiple pieces so we can provide ChatGPT with a larger context We had the problem with large patches that we had to work with a maximum token size of 4096 tokens.  The following changes were made: 1. Split the patch with the parse-diff library 2. Recompile the patch again with different pieces, and add enough context for ChatGPT to understand the changes 3. Truncate only long patch pieces, instead of the entire patch 4. Exclude package.json files, as those don't provide additional value, similar to binary files This should provide a much more complete code review compared to the previous version. Solves #19

PULL-REQUEST,  DISCARDED, Fix some typos, transcribe Practical AI soundbite (Changelog News 2023-04-03.md) I thought I would just fix a few typos, but it turned into a thing. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ Were you trolling Daniel by including that soundbite? I guess I could've used Whisper to do the transcription and asked ChatGPT to summarize the salient points, but I did it the old-fashioned way instead. Here's the original, if you were looking for 100% accuracy: > The model has no clue what it's saying, and nor does it have any, sort of, like, morality or, uh, like, it has no clue what it's saying, right? It's just producing coherent output, the same whether it's a text-to-image model, or it's a language model, like, there's no basis in, like, knowing what it's saying. It's auto-completing text, right? Like, at the end of the day, yes, like, that's a vast over-simplification, and you can not like that, but, but ultimately, you're giving a prompt, and it is producing output that is seeded by that prompt, right, and it's just trying to produce this coherent output that's consistent with both the data that it's seeing and maybe some type of extra mechanism like the human feedback or something that it's seeing. But ultimately it's just producing output that seems coherent and probable. It has no clue what it's saying…

PULL-REQUEST,  DISCARDED, Rosetta Additions I used ChatGPT to start filling out some of the $LANGUAGE => Scala sections, with some slight editing afterard. For posterity, here's generally what I fed the machine: ``` I want you to act as a software developer that has advanced experience in all languages. Your job is to onboard me to Scala from another language when I ask you to. For Scala, you only use the following IDEs: - IntelliJ Idea - Visual Studio Code with the Metals extension For Scala, you only use the following build tools: - sbt In your comparisons, do not mention: - The Eclipse IDE - Ivy - Maven - Gradle Compare the typical tooling, and project structure from my language. For the following sections, outline similarities to Scala: - build tools - package managers - dependency caching - project source tree structure     - Print a typical file tree structure of a "Hello World" application including tests in my language, and then a corresponding one in Scala. Do don't respond unless I ask you to onboard me from another language. ``` and then `onboard me from $LANGUAGE`.

PULL-REQUEST,  DISCARDED, Add support for auto generating metrics ### Features and Changes This PR introduces logic to automatically generate metrics for our various event trackers. In it's current state, this only supports `Segment` & `Rudderstack`. Once I get some initial feedback on the overall structure of the PR, I'll expand to include additional event trackers, specifically GA4, Firebase, and Amplitude, with more to follow in separate PRs. To do this, when an organization adds a datasource via an event tracker supported above, they'll see an option on the `NewDataSourceForm` to look up what metrics we can generate for them automatically. I built a method within `SqlIntegration` that adds a `supportsAutoGeneratedMetrics` property to the integration's `getDataSourceProperties` so we can easily determine on the front and back end if the particular data source supports auto generating metrics. ```ts isAutoGeneratingMetricsSupported(): boolean {     const supportedEventTrackers: SchemaFormat[] = ["segment", "rudderstack"];     if (       this.settings.schemaFormat &&       supportedEventTrackers.includes(this.settings.schemaFormat)     ) {       return true;     }     return false;   } ``` This hits a new endpoint `/datasource/:datasourceId/auto-metrics` - This endpoint looks up the unique events that are tracked by the event tracker. This is possible since the event trackers all have a table that lists all of the events that they track. In the case of `Segment` & `Rudderstack` this lives on the `tracks` table. The endpoint returns a list of events that we think we can generate, along with sql queries for `count` and `binomial` metrics derived from the tracked events. Here, the user can preview the underlying SQL that would eventually power these metrics, and opt to create `binomial` and `count` metrics for each tracked event. I've added some tooltips throughout the table to provide some insight. Then, when the user clicks "Save" if there are any metrics they've indicated they want us to create for them, (via the toggle state) we'll kick off an async job (`createAutoGeneratedMetrics`) that creates those metrics. There has also been some logic defined to pluralize the event names (E.G. for an `Order Placed` event via Segment, the `count` metric associated with that would be `Orders Placed`.) This is currently handled via a pretty simple map. Eventually, we could leverage ChatGPT for this. If the map is unable to map an event to a pluralized version, it will simply return a displayName of `Count of {event}`. The seed for the pluralization map came from Segment's documentation here - https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/ecommerce/v2/. This map will likely be a bit of a living document as we expand support. ### Testing - [x] Set up a Segment destination with BigQuery and add that data source to GrowthBook and confirm all tracked events are displayed and created correctly, with the correct underlying sql query. - [x] Ensure the above works for revenue, count. and binomial metrics. ### Screenshots <img width="821" alt="Screen Shot 2023-06-01 at 3 51 48 PM" src="https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook/assets/75274610/6433efd1-132d-4df6-bed4-4d60287c7270"> <img width="816" alt="Screen Shot 2023-06-01 at 3 52 36 PM" src="https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook/assets/75274610/e2ccaadc-7584-4584-84fc-03064b078841"> <img width="814" alt="Screen Shot 2023-06-07 at 10 31 52 AM" src="https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook/assets/75274610/54de3708-e3ff-4dab-a8b7-3352ead9e275"> <img width="811" alt="Screen Shot 2023-06-01 at 3 53 02 PM" src="https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook/assets/75274610/95c95101-5787-42ff-8fb2-e72ae93f271e"> <img width="799" alt="Screen Shot 2023-06-07 at 10 33 18 AM" src="https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook/assets/75274610/f4db1c69-5443-4cd6-ba1a-6f6a86758a3f"> 
PULL-REQUEST,  DISCARDED, Implement detection of ChatGPT response completion (#12) This commit addresses issue #12, which aimed to improve the automation of ChatGPT by accurately detecting when a ChatGPT response is completed. Previously, it was challenging to determine when the ChatGPT response was completed due to the streaming nature of the text to the browser. This led to inefficient techniques like `time.sleep` being used to retrieve the output. In this commit, we have implemented a reliable method to detect when a ChatGPT response is completed. We achieved this by checking for changes in the `div` class of the response element (from "result-streaming" to "markdown") and using `invisibility_of_element_located` to wait for the streaming response element to become invisible. This change allows us to obtain the output accurately and efficiently, improving the overall performance of the ChatGPT automation script.

Typing all this out and then having to wait for the new code to be generated is very boring. Also, it would be nice if the code would be visualized after being generated, but sadly the stock ChatGPT site doesn't support that. ## Solution Integrate ChatGPT into Utopia ### TODOs - [ ] The design of the chat tab is super basic, should be upgraded - [ ] There's no loading screen yet and completions are **really** slow, maybe it should use streaming? - [ ] The OpenAI API call will have to be moved to the backend, so that the API key is not exposed

PULL-REQUEST,  DISCARDED, feat: option to automatically calculate response token count ### Related Issues This implements https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack/issues/5047 ### Proposed Changes: Calculate the number of response tokens automatically based on the token length of the prompt and the maximum token length for the model. When specifying `max_length=None` on `PromptNode` using ChatGPT models, the length of the response is automatically calculated. ### How did you test it? Have yet to do this, can't get testing up and running locally. Will observe CI/CD. ### Checklist - I have read the [contributors guidelines](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and the [code of conduct](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack/blob/main/code_of_conduct.txt) - I have updated the related issue with new insights and changes - ~I added unit tests and updated the docstrings~ _Not yet_ - I've used one of the [conventional commit types](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for my PR title: `fix:`, `feat:`, `build:`, `chore:`, `ci:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `test:`. - I documented my code - I ran [pre-commit hooks](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#installation) and fixed any issue
