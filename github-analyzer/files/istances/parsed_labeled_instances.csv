COMMIT,  process, Add EPSS Ingestor command to ingest-worker (#1070) Detailed Summary: - This commit adds a new epss command to the ingest-worker. - The epss command includes an "ingest" subcommand which allows the user to update EPSS scores. - The epss command is implemented using the clifx library and includes a NewCommand function to create the cli.Command struct. - The epss command has a dependency on an EPSSIngester interface which is provided through the fx dependency injection library. - The epss command logs informative messages when starting and completing the ingestion process. (Thank ChatGPT for the git commit message lol) The SQL I wrote is the fastest that I could figure out. The first implementation took >10 minutes and this one takes about 30 seconds now. It turns out that query for the IDs ahead of time and then running an "UPDATE" for that is the fastest way.

COMMIT,  documentation, chore: update multiple-environments feature flag criteria  (#22627) ## Description As part of ongoing efforts to improve our feature flagging process, this Pull Request updates the "multiple-environments" feature flag criteria to limit access to a specific list of email addresses, rather than the entire Appsmith domain. This will help to reduce the impact of the latest merges and ensure that only authorised users have access to the feature. Specifically, this Pull Request modifies the existing criteria for the "multiple-environments" feature flag and changes the access control from email domains to individual email addresses. This ensures that only users with approved email addresses can access the feature, and reduces the risk of unauthorised access or unintended consequences resulting from recent code merges. description generated by chatGPT The email addresses are as follows: 1. [me-eng1@appsmith.com](mailto:me-eng1@appsmith.com) 2. [me-eng2@appsmith.com](mailto:me-eng2@appsmith.com) 3. [me-qa1@appsmith.com](mailto:me-qa1@appsmith.com) 4.

COMMIT,  feature implementation/enhancement, feat: chatgpt review
COMMIT,  software quality, ChatGPT is refactoring-ish ChatGPT: A giant prompt and response below Human: There are still bits to do, and some suggestions were not great. >>> Prompt: Given this extract of javascript functions, names, classes, how should I refactor this into more managable files or modules or classes. RIght now they sit in one file:     class Lemming     function getDefaultLevelData(givenLevel = {})     function spawnLemming()     function playSoundEffect(name)     function createLemmings(amount)     function generateMapNoiseHash()     function generateMap(canvasWidth, canvasHeight)     function PerlinNoise2D(x, y) {     function fade(t) {     function lerp(t, a, b) {     function grad(hash, x, y) {     function renderDirtTexture()     function renderWaterTexture()     function renderRockTexture() {     function drawShapes(context, shapesArr)     function backupGradients(gradients) {     function setGradients(context, gradients)     function getHeightAdjustment(lem)     function getRectanglePoints(lemming, angle, length, height, collisionColors, offsetX = 0, offsetFromFeetY = 0, debugDraw = false) {     function startDigging(lemming)     function bash(lemming)     function dig(lemming)     function build(lemming)     function createHole(x, y) {     function doProgrammedActions(lemming)     function isPointWithinCircle(x,y,a,b,radius) {     function togglePause()     function toggleSetting(setting)     function Particle(x, y) {         Particle.prototype.update = function()         Particle.prototype.draw = function()     }     function spawnCombatText(text)     function applyAction(action)     function moveOverlappingLemmingsToRandomSideOfBlocker(blocker) {     function isColliding(obj1, obj2) {     function stopAction() {     function updateInfoDiv(lem)     function setPixel(x, y, colorBytes) {     function clearPixel(x, y, grayScale = 0) {     function getUniqueColors(canvas) {     function getPixelColor(imageData, x, y) {     function pixelIsColor(imageData, x, y, color, debug) {     function getPixelIndex(x, y, width) {     function isColorOneOf(needle, haystack) {     function getTerrainColors() {     function isPixelOneOf(imageData, x, y, haystack) {     function bound(value, min, max) {     function clearSmoothingOfTerrain(canvas, keepColors) {     function rgbToHex(r, g, b) {     function RNG(seed) {     function setBackgroundBuffer() {     function serialize(data) {     function deserialize(data) {     function saveToLocalStorage(key, data) {     function getFromLocalStorage(key) {     function fadeInCanvas() {     function fadeOutCanvas() {     function getOverallScore()     function levelCompleted()     function levelFailed()     function setupUI()     function getLemmingsRemaining()     function update() {     function startCanvasEventListeners()     function clearSquare(x, y, radius)     function checkLemmingFinish(lemming, finish) {     function setupStartFinish()     function renderDecorations()     function capitalize(str)     function adjustCanvasHeight()     function keyBindPressed(action)     function selectNextLemming() {     function selectPreviousLemming() {     function deselectLemmings() {     function restartLevel(canvasElt)     function exitGame()     function reset()     function initBackground()     function init(canvasElt, givenLevel = {}, debug = false)     function preStart()     function _start()     async function generateSprites()     async function _runOnce(resetLocalStorage = false)     function startGame() >>> ====================================================== >>> Human: I will include what ChatGPT said in response... >>> ====================================================== It seems like you have a lot of functions and classes in one file. It's recommended to break them down into smaller, more manageable files or modules based on their purpose. Assuming that these functions and classes are part of a game engine or game development project, here is a possible way to organize them into different files or modules: lemming.js: contains the Lemming class and related functions (getDefaultLevelData, spawnLemming,             createLemmings, etc.) sound.js: contains the playSoundEffect function map.js: contains functions related to map generation (generateMapNoiseHash, generateMap, PerlinNoise2D,         fade, lerp, grad, etc.), as well as functions for rendering textures (renderDirtTexture,         renderWaterTexture, renderRockTexture) and shapes (drawShapes, getRectanglePoints). actions.js: contains functions for lemming actions (startDigging, bash, dig, build, etc.), as well as             helper functions (getRectanglePoints, getHeightAdjustment) and related classes (Particle). collision.js: contains functions for handling collisions (moveOverlappingLemmingsToRandomSideOfBlocker,               isColliding, etc.), as well as helper functions (isPointWithinCircle). util.js: contains general utility functions (togglePause, toggleSetting, spawnCombatText, applyAction,          stopAction, updateInfoDiv, setPixel, clearPixel, getUniqueColors, getPixelColor, pixelIsColor,          getPixelIndex, isColorOneOf, getTerrainColors, isPixelOneOf, bound, clearSmoothingOfTerrain,          rgbToHex, RNG, setBackgroundBuffer, serialize, deserialize, saveToLocalStorage, getFromLocalStorage,          fadeInCanvas, fadeOutCanvas, getOverallScore, levelCompleted, levelFailed, setupUI,          getLemmingsRemaining, update, startCanvasEventListeners, clearSquare, checkLemmingFinish,          setupStartFinish, renderDecorations, capitalize, adjustCanvasHeight, keyBindPressed,          selectNextLemming, selectPreviousLemming, deselectLemmings, restartLevel, exitGame, reset,          initBackground, preStart, _start, generateSprites, _runOnce, startGame). main.js: contains the main logic for the game, such as setting up the canvas, loading assets, initializing          the game state, and starting the game loop. By breaking down your code into smaller files or          modules, you can make it easier to manage and maintain, as well as make it easier to update and          debug. You can also more easily reuse and share code between different projects. Remember to          properly export and import your functions and classes based on your language and module system.
